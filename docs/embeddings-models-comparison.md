# Vector Database Comparison: FAISS vs Others

## FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)

**Type**: Library/Toolkit  
**Architecture**: In-memory, library-based  
**Language**: C++ with Python bindings  

**Strengths:**
- Extremely fast similarity search
- Highly optimized algorithms (IVF, HNSW, PQ)
- GPU acceleration support
- Minimal overhead (no server/network layer)
- Production-proven at Facebook scale
- Excellent for embedding-only use cases

**Limitations:**
- Not a full database (no built-in persistence)
- No distributed architecture out-of-box
- No metadata filtering during search
- Requires manual index management
- No built-in API server

## Qdrant

**Type**: Full Vector Database  
**Architecture**: Client-server, distributed  
**Language**: Rust  

**Strengths:**
- Built-in persistence and replication
- Advanced filtering with payload indexes
- REST/gRPC APIs
- Distributed architecture
- Dynamic index updates
- Snapshot/backup support
- Cloud-native design

**Limitations:**
- Higher latency than FAISS
- More resource overhead
- Smaller community than FAISS

## Weaviate

**Type**: Full Vector Database  
**Architecture**: Client-server, GraphQL-based  
**Language**: Go  

**Strengths:**
- Schema-based data model
- GraphQL API
- Built-in vectorization modules
- Hybrid search (vector + keyword)
- Multi-tenancy support
- Automatic backups
- Cloud and self-hosted options

**Limitations:**
- Complex setup compared to FAISS
- GraphQL learning curve
- Higher resource requirements
