# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Key Concepts

- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled examples
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction and rewards

Machine learning algorithms can identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns.
