# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) combines computational linguistics with statistical machine learning and deep learning models.

## Applications

NLP enables computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data for:
- Text analysis and sentiment detection
- Language translation
- Chatbots and conversational AI
- Information extraction from documents

The field has advanced significantly with transformer architectures and large language models.
