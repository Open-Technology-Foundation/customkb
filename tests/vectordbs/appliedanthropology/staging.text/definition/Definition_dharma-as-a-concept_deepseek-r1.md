Alright, so I need to define "dharma" as a concept and then provided examples from cultures or subcultures outside of Buddhism or Hinduism. 

Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, understanding dharma. From what I know, it's a term that comes from Sanskrit and is often associated with religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. In those contexts, it usually refers to one's duty, moral order, or the right way of living. But the user wants me to define it as a concept more broadly.

So, thinking about dharma in a general sense, it seems to be about principles that govern behavior and provide meaning. It's like a code or set of values that people follow within a particular group or society.

This makes me think that dharma can exist in any culture, not just the ones where the term is traditionally used.

Now, I need examples from cultures or subcultures outside of Buddhism or Hinduism. Let me consider different groups and what their "dharma" might be.

Maybe starting with something like the samurai code in Japan. Bushido comes to mind. It's a set of principles that include honor, loyalty, discipline, and courage. That seems similar to dharma—guiding how individuals should behave within their role or community.

Another thought is the concept of "ubuntu" from African cultures, particularly in South Africa. Ubuntu emphasizes community, harmony, and interconnectedness. It's about treating others with kindness and respect because your humanity is tied to theirs. This feels like a form of dharma too, as it's a moral framework for living.

In the West, maybe the Hippie movement of the 1960s had its own set of principles. They valued peace, love, communal living, and environmental harmony. These values could be seen as their version of dharma, guiding their lifestyle and interactions.

Punk rock culture also has a distinct set of ethics — anti-authoritarianism, DIY ethos, individual freedom, and challenging societal norms. This is another example where a subculture defines its own moral guidelines, similar to dharma.

Looking at sports teams or military units, there's often a strong sense of duty and loyalty. These groups have unwritten codes that members are expected to follow, which can be seen as their version of dharma.

Also, environmentalism has its own ethical framework—living sustainably, reducing harm to the planet, promoting eco-consciousness. This could be another form of dharma for those within the movement.

Wait, I should make sure these examples aren't directly tied to Hindu or Buddhist teachings. Bushido is from Shinto and Japanese culture, Ubuntu from African philosophy, Hippie from Western counterculture, Punk rock as a subculture, sports/military as social groups, environmentalism as a global movement. These all seem appropriate.

I think I have a good list. Now, to structure this into a clear response—define dharma broadly and then provide each example with an explanation.



**Definition of Dharma:**
