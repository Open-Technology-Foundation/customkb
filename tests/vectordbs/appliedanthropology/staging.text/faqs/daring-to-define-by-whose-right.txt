# Daring to define. By whose right?

Defining definition.

Language, symbols, ideas, cultural sub-references. The problem of language: linguistic baggage, emotional associations, internal cultural cross-referencing, and etymological evolution.

A dharma is any kind of actively lived philosophy, way, or custom that is psycho-socially embedded within an individual or group and that affects the manner in which the individual or group interacts with other individuals or groups.

Why define? We need to be speaking the same language. Development and evolution of a dharmic vocabulary.

There are many kinds of dharmas. There is no "the dharma." Some kinds of dharmas have been given names; most remain nameless, indistinct, or hidden.

Dharmas are the most basic discourses of humanity, and most probably, for all hominids, both past and present.

Individuals and groups have multiple dharmas to which they subscribe, consciously or unconsciously.

Most dharmas focus upon the unity of a group, out of which inevitably comes an attachment to an identity based on that unity. Thus, a dharma precedes and defines an identity.

A dharma is any kind of lived psychological outlook.

A "lived philosophy" is a human or group way of being, with a set of basic beliefs, rituals, skill-sets, and a lived everyday practice that is more, rather than less, consistent with those beliefs.

A dharma is a conscious subculture within a larger society.

Warrior dharmas include Maori, samurai, Maasai, knights, and marines.

Many lived philosophies encompass ideas such as compassion, in particular towards fellow adherents, but also, to greater or lesser degrees, their encompassing groups and lateral outgroups.

My dharma or path holds to a belief that compassion and fairness should be the basis of all human interaction.
