Q: What differentiates secular dharmas from other dharmas?

A: Secular dharma, often associated with movements like Secular Buddhism, typically differentiates itself from traditional dharmas in several ways:

Non-religious Framework: Secular dharma often exists outside the framework of traditional religious structures and beliefs. It usually emphasizes practical, experiential, and rational aspects of the dharma without necessarily adhering to supernatural beliefs or traditional religious rituals.

Inclusivity and Universality: Secular dharma is typically characterized by an inclusive approach that welcomes individuals from all or no religious backgrounds. It often emphasizes universal aspects of human experience and ethics, making it accessible to a broader audience.

Critical Inquiry and Adaptability: Followers of secular dharma often encourage critical inquiry and adaptability, incorporating contemporary understanding from fields like psychology, philosophy, and science. This approach often leads to reinterpretation and evolution of traditional teachings to suit modern contexts and understandings.

Focus on This Life: While many traditional dharmas may include teachings about rebirth or other realms, secular dharma tends to focus on this life and how to live it meaningfully and ethically, with a focus on the here and now rather than post-mortem consequences or cosmological speculations.

It's important to note that these characteristics can vary widely within secular dharma movements and interpretations. The information provided here is a general overview and might not capture all nuances or specific teachings of a particular secular dharma community, or of a dharmist individual.
