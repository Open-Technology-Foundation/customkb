# I Never Thought 60 Would Feel Like This

Turning 60 is one of those big milestones that you think you're ready for, like when you turn 40 or 50, but you don't always realize the roller coaster you end up on. That's what happened to me. I want to talk about what I went through, how I thought I was just fine with turning 60, the roller coaster of emotions that happened, and how I am now.

I thought I'd come out here into the woods, but I'm a little bit nervous because it is spring, and we do have bears here. There's a young guy on a bicycle. It's really pretty here. Look at it—this is a little bridge, and down there, when there's more water, it's more of a creek. Now it's just a tiny trickle of water. Isn't it pretty out here? Anyway, let's see if I can do this.

Hi, I'm Anilly. If you're new here, I'm a wife, mother, grandmother, nurse, and I just turned 60. I wanted to talk about how I felt turning 60 and how I feel now that I am 60. I actually made some notes so I don't ramble too much. I don't know how you felt during the different milestones. This is a big milestone for me, to stand out here relatively in the middle of nowhere and not put the camera away. This is huge for me because sometimes, or most of the time, I would put it away.

This topic isn't for everyone because it feels a bit embarrassing. This video isn't for you if you feel like this has no impact on you, birthdays and things like that. But if it's something you're wondering about, I'll just tell you how I felt. This is just my own personal experience, and I'm sure there are many varieties of this experience and how we all feel emotionally.

I really didn't have an issue when I was 40. I don't even remember many emotions about that, and the same for 50. I remember turning 50 and feeling like it was a big thing, but I didn't have any lasting emotional feelings. I don't remember being in any kind of turmoil or funk about it either. So this took me a little by surprise because I figured I was going to feel something a little deeper this time around. I was preparing myself. I even made videos about how I had all these goals and things I was going to hit when I turned this age. I was prepping myself for a possible emotional funk.

As the time drew closer and my birthday was just a week ago, it all of a sudden hit me. I ended up feeling this incredible feeling of loss and sadness. It's not for anything that I don't physically have or a loss of a person. It was just the impending feeling of loss of time. That's the biggest thing that surprised me the most. It's not about the things I don't have or the things I wish I'd done. I wished I had accomplished more, but it was the realization that time is becoming less and less that impacted me. I was surprised by that. I thought I would be sad because I hadn't hit all the goals I'd set for myself, but it wasn't about that. It was about looking into the future and thinking about it, which makes me emotional even now. I had a mini breakdown thinking about my kids and grandkids. I've gone through losing both my parents, aunts, and many family members, even on my husband's side. I've seen a lot of loss in emergency and ICU settings, witnessing how it affects loved ones.

The unexpected thing was the loss of time that hit me. I didn't notice this when I turned 40 or 50. I even considered whether I might need to see a doctor and discuss antidepressants. I've had to do that occasionally due to situational issues that made me feel down, needing something to help me through those stages. I think I'm making it to the other side of it now. I didn't fall into clinical depression, but the impact of that birthday and thoughts of time hit me hard.

The weekend of my birthday was quite a struggle. I just went through the motions and allowed myself to feel sorry for myself. I didn't do anything, which was kind of sad, but what's the point of fighting it? Like many, I've experienced times when I had to push through things. I only had to push through certain family gatherings, and then I could let myself wallow in the feelings and get through it. I think that's what helped me start rising up from that.

If you've experienced something like this and felt this deep sadness, let me know. I'm curious how others deal with it and what they've done to help. Years ago, I listened to a book, though I can't remember its name. At the time, I forced myself to listen to it, thinking it was too out there for me. However, the author made points about being in the present, emphasizing that now is all you have and all that matters. I literally put that into a Google search because I wanted to find out what the book was. Do you know what the book was that I listened to? It was "The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle. It's a really famous book, and I couldn't remember it. Since listening to it and thinking it was so out there for me, I have thought about that book and the little things, like how it's the now that matters. Everything is perfect right now. I'm probably paraphrasing this all wrong, but the gist of it is that there is only the here and now, and this moment.

I was thinking about that and realizing, okay, this is life, and this is the here and now that I have to embrace. Somehow, millions and millions of other people have gone through this. I can get through this too. I think the only thing that really helped me is that I let myself wallow in these feelings, just feel it all, be miserable, be sad, and then slowly I started to notice that I can start planning again. I can start feeling hopeful, being excited, and thinking about things.

This is not easy, I think. Even if you've got everything that you absolutely always wanted to attain, even if you've hit all your goals—career, home, physical health—I think you still might have these feelings. It was none of the above that impacted me the most. It was just knowing that there are only so many more summers and Christmases to be had. I'm not even going to think about that right now because that's what will get me further into that again.

I think I'm going to have to re-listen to or read that book again because it must have had an impact on me to think about it six or seven years later. When I was reading some reviews on that book, it did say that people have reread it or gone back to it and picked up some other little nuggets from it. But that's all I remembered, really: it's only the here and now that you have, and it's a perfect moment. This is all you need to think about—the here and now and the present.

Going forward, this is going to be a good year. I'm going to continue my walk in the beautiful forest. It's early in the morning, and I'm going to go out and meet my daughter. It's still part of the birthday celebration this weekend, so I'll do that. Bye.
