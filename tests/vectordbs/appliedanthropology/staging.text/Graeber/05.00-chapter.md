The chapter "Many Seasons Ago" examines the complexities of pre-agricultural societies in North America, particularly focusing on the indigenous peoples of California and the Northwest Coast. It challenges the notion that these societies were merely primitive hunter-gatherers, highlighting their sedentary villages, monumental structures, and advanced social organization.

The authors critique the tendency of scholars to overlook or misinterpret the significance of these complex societies, often labeling them as anomalies or transitional phases toward agriculture. They emphasize that California's indigenous peoples were not pre-agricultural but actively rejected agriculture in favor of a rich foraging lifestyle, particularly relying on acorns and other local resources.

The chapter explores cultural differentiation, questioning why certain groups, like those in California, systematically rejected domesticated crops despite their availability. It suggests that this rejection was not solely based on environmental efficiency but also reflected deeper cultural values and identities.

The authors discuss the concept of "culture areas," originally proposed by anthropologists like Franz Boas, which categorized societies based on shared cultural traits rather than subsistence methods. They argue that cultural identities were often formed in opposition to neighboring groups, a process termed schismogenesis, where societies define themselves against one another.

The chapter contrasts the social structures of the Northwest Coast, characterized by hierarchical systems and the institution of slavery, with those of California, where such practices were absent. It highlights the differences in wealth accumulation and social organization, noting that Northwest Coast societies engaged in potlatch ceremonies, which emphasized competition and status, while Californian societies focused on individual ownership and modesty.

The authors delve into the role of slavery, noting its prevalence in the Northwest Coast due to the aristocratic need for controllable labor, contrasting it with the ethical and political dimensions that led Californians to reject such practices. They present the story of the Chetco Nation as a cautionary tale about the dangers of slavery and the moral implications of wealth accumulation.

Ultimately, the chapter argues that understanding these cultural processes is crucial for comprehending how societies navigate issues of freedom, inequality, and social organization, emphasizing that the dynamics of power and identity have deep historical roots that continue to influence contemporary social structures.
