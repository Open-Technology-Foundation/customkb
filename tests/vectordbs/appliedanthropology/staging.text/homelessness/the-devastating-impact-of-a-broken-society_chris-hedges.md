# The Devastating Impact of a Broken Society

Chris Hedges


    Pain doesn’t just vanish -- it turns into something far more dangerous.
  
    The Devastating Impact of a Broken Society | Why Hurt People Hurt People, narrated by Chris Hedges, takes a powerful look at how systemic disconnection and social breakdown lead to cycles of pain and destruction. In this compelling video, Hedges examines the root causes of trauma, revealing how societal neglect fosters despair, violence, and self-destruction. Through poignant insights, he uncovers how the loss of meaningful work, community, and dignity drives individuals to harm themselves and others.
  
    Hedges explores how deindustrialization and the erosion of social infrastructure have devastated working-class communities, leaving millions alienated and disconnected. He paints a vivid picture of a society that denies people avenues to self-actualize, stripping them of the dignity needed to thrive. In the vacuum left behind, addiction, violence, and hate take root—symptoms of a deeper societal rupture that prioritizes profit and control over human well-being.
  
    Through examples such as the opioid epidemic, broken urban centers, and the collapse of unions, Hedges highlights how these structural failings perpetuate trauma and create a vicious cycle. Those who inflict harm are often responding to their own unacknowledged pain, acting out of a profound sense of loss and self-destruction. This powerful narrative challenges us to confront the systemic roots of harm rather than treating its symptoms.
  
    The Devastating Impact of a Broken Society is both a critique of systemic inequality and a call to action. Chris Hedges emphasizes the urgent need to reinvest in people and rebuild the social bonds that nurture humanity. This video is essential viewing for those seeking to understand the deeper causes of societal dysfunction and explore pathways toward healing and transformation.

At its core, trauma is about the inability to feel.

It's being cut off from your own humanity and the humanity of others.

What is it that drives groups and individuals to carry out acts of self destruction, self annihilation?

When people are completely cornered and the only way they feel they can affirm themselves is to destroy, they will.

This rupture of social bonds - people are pushed outside the system.

So that all of the ways that they can actualize themselves, find dignity within the social structure are denied to them, and they essentially affirm themselves through destructive acts.

Work is not simply about exchanging labor for a wage.

Work is about family.

It's about being able to live within the society with dignity.

We've taken that away from the working class, especially with the destruction of unions and deindustrialization.

All the manufacturing has been offshored.

Much of my family comes from working class Maine and the mills are all gone.

Even the bank is boarded up.

There's methamphetamine labs everywhere.

Camden, New Jersey was a hundred years ago a huge manufacturing center.

RCA was there.

Campbell Soup, which still has a headquarters, but they don't make soup there.

And now the population is cut in half.

And essentially what we see in these urban centers is that inability to be integrated within the society.

The opioid crisis, alcoholism, gambling, suicide, hate groups are an inevitable response to the rupture of social bonds.

That's because those who seek the annihilation of others are driven by feelings of self annihilation.

We have to rebuild the social infrastructure.

It really comes down to investing in people, not into systems of control.
