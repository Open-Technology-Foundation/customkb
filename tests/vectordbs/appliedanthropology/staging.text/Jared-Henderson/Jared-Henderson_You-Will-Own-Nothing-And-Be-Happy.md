# "You Will Own Nothing": "and be happy"

by **Jared Henderson**

Over the past year or so, I've become very concerned about ownership rights, especially in the digital realm. In 2023, Sony announced that purchased content would be removed from customers' libraries due to difficulties in renewing a licensing agreement with Discovery, the original content provider. This meant that customers who had already paid for the content would no longer have access to it. Understandably, people were upset, and Sony quickly backtracked. They managed to negotiate a deal, allowing customers to retain access to the content they had paid for.

This issue is not unique to Sony. Amazon could also remove movie purchases at any time, and it's not limited to movies. It could affect television shows or, in Amazon's case, ebooks. In the broader digital landscape, this could happen on iTunes or any of Apple's services, as well as on Steam with video games. Generally, when buying digital content online, you don't own it. This problem has become so widespread that California recently passed a law requiring marketplaces to disclose that customers are purchasing a license, which comes with terms and can be revoked.

Ownership rights are being eroded. We are moving away from a model where paying for something means you get to keep it, toward a model where you are simply licensing something or subscribing perpetually. You may have heard the phrase, "You will own nothing and be happy." This video will explore the issues with digital ownership and the erosion of ownership rights in the modern world. It also advocates for buying physical media, which typically doesn't come with DRM.

For example, if you buy a book from a bookstore, you can take it home and have the right to do with it as you see fit. You can read it, keep it on a shelf, burn it, or even eat it. However, there are limitations, such as not being able to copy and sell or distribute the content for free. Owning media has always come with some conditions, but generally, if you bought it, you could keep it and do with it as you wished. You could also sell it to someone else once you were done with it. There was a legal controversy about a decade ago involving a company named Redigi, which attempted to create a marketplace where owners of digital media could sell their copies. The idea was that once owners could prove they had obtained the media from a legal marketplace, and using technology developed by Redigi, they could also prove they no longer had access to the media. This aimed to enable the resale of digital content without retaining copies illegally. However, the music industry, particularly, opposed this concept. In 2012, Capitol Records sued Redigi, leading to an ongoing legal battle. Redigi even attempted to take the case to the Supreme Court, but the rulings have been clear: selling digital content is not legally viable.

This issue revolves around the applicability of the first sale doctrine. The first sale doctrine protects the right to resell physical goods that you purchase. Although there have been challenges to this doctrine, generally, if you buy something, you can sell it to someone else later. The question was whether the first sale doctrine applies to digital purchases, and the courts have essentially answered no. As a result, Redigi was shut down in 2013, despite their continued legal efforts.

At one point, both Amazon and Apple were working on similar technology, exploring the idea of tracking ownership of digital goods. They even applied for patents, but these ideas seemed to have died with the Redigi case. This situation highlights how digital ownership is fundamentally different from the ownership of physical goods.

Consider this scenario: you buy a $50 piece of software for your job, use it for a month and a half, and then decide it's not for you. What can you do with that software? In most cases, it just sits on your hard drive, or you delete it. You can't legally pass it on to someone else. For example, if you bought digital art software and realized you're not a good artist, you might want to give it to a friend who is a good artist and needs new software. Legally, you can't do that. The same applies to books, movies, television shows, and music, unless you physically give someone your e-reader. If you want to transfer software or files from your device, like an iPod, to someone else, you would need to physically give them the device where those files reside. Kindle once had a lending option that allowed you to let friends or family read your Kindle books. They ensured you couldn't access those books simultaneously, but Amazon quietly deprecated that feature. Now, if you have an ebook you want someone else to read, they must either borrow it from their library or purchase it themselves; they can't borrow it from you.

This inability to lend or give away digital content when you no longer want it forces us to become perpetual customers. This concept isn't limited to media; it extends to other areas, such as tabletop role-playing games and Magic: The Gathering. Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering are now owned by Hasbro, a large toy company. Hasbro is known for trying to extract as much value as possible from these franchises, often without considering the players' or fans' perspectives.

Hasbro has moved these platforms into the digital realm. This shift can be beneficial if you want to play Dungeons & Dragons or other tabletop role-playing games with friends remotely. You can use a Virtual Tabletop (VTT) or a service developed by Wizards of the Coast called D&D Beyond. For Magic: The Gathering, there are Magic: The Gathering Online and Magic: The Gathering Arena. I will focus on Arena for these examples.

One feature of D&D Beyond is the ability to purchase core rulebooks or supplemental texts for Dungeons & Dragons. However, I have an entire shelf of physical books, which highlights the ongoing debate about digital versus physical ownership. For tabletop role-playing, I do not buy from D&D Beyond. If you purchase digital content from D&D Beyond, it's like all other digital content—you do not actually own it; you are just purchasing a license. At some point, people might get tired of seeing terms of service, but it's necessary to highlight that all these companies operate similarly. When you buy digital content, you are not actually buying it; you are licensing it, and they can take it away or change it.

D&D Beyond also has a subscription model, which turns us into perpetual customers. By paying a monthly fee, you get early access to new books, and with a higher fee, even earlier access, which might appeal to hardcore fans. You can share the content you bought with friends on D&D Beyond, but notice that your right to share is contingent on paying a monthly fee. If you stop subscribing, you can't share that content anymore.

Think of Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons as great in-person hobbies. The only hobby more tactile and tangible might be something like Warhammer 40k. These experiences are about being around a table with friends. Sometimes, we move to digital tools because we can't always meet in person or don't have a playgroup nearby, which is understandable. However, we inherently lose something in these digital environments. Worse, the companies owning these franchises see digital as a way to gain a perpetual revenue stream.

In the case of Magic: The Gathering Arena, it's a bit different. Arena is technically free to play, so you can log on and start playing. However, as new cards come out, you are highly incentivized to spend money on cards. You could end up spending as much money playing Magic: The Gathering Arena as you would buying physical cards from a local game store or online. If you follow any news in these hobbies, you'll know that the cost of cards, boxes, and booster packs has increased significantly. Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro are trying to capture your dollars. When you move on to platforms like D&D Beyond or Magic: The Gathering Arena, it's important to consider what happens if Hasbro decides to stop supporting those platforms. Currently, D&D Beyond is doing okay, but there are concerns, especially since Dungeons & Dragons isn't generating as much revenue for Hasbro as they would like. If D&D Beyond were to shut down, you would lose access to all of your digital books. This is different from owning physical books. For example, I have 3.5 rule books in my mom's basement that I should retrieve. Despite being in my 30s, I still have those books, and I can access them anytime because I own them.

Additionally, I own alternative games like Pathfinder or Shadow Dark, and I can consult those books just by looking at my shelf. Many smaller publishers in the indie space provide PDFs when you buy their books. They risk piracy but prioritize customer satisfaction by offering PDFs. I think this is a great model.

You might assume Hasbro would never shut down D&D Beyond or Magic: The Gathering Arena, but companies can go out of business or sell franchises, leading to services being discontinued. Teams that support software can disappear, and beloved products can be unexpectedly dropped. Consider all the companies from which you buy digital goods, like Hasbro, Amazon, or Apple. Some of these companies might go out of business, suffer data loss, or encounter issues that result in losing access to purchased content.

I've tried to switch to buying almost exclusively physical media to avoid this risk. While there are downsides to physical media, such as storage challenges, I prefer the security of owning what I pay for. Despite the inconvenience, keeping my purchases is most important to me. Let's discuss the issue of moving towards perpetual subscriptions. Not everyone objects to all subscriptions, and it's helpful to make some distinctions. For instance, I subscribe to a couple of newspapers and magazines. My understanding of that subscription is that I get ongoing access to those newspapers, magazines, and their websites, and in return, I pay a monthly fee. My fee helps them create new content. For example, by subscribing to The New York Times, I'm helping bring tomorrow's paper to fruition, which I then get to read. This is similar to newsletters. I write on Substack, and while I give most of my content away for free, I rely on subscriptions for a decent portion of my income. Some people subscribe to support my work, for which I'm very thankful. Many realize that by paying a monthly subscription fee, they help ensure I can continue producing content they enjoy.

We are unlikely to live in a world free of subscriptions, and I must be transparent in saying that I make part of my living through them. However, what's troubling is the shift to subscriptions for things that you could previously purchase outright, particularly software. A prime example is Adobe. Adobe's Creative Suite has become integral in various creative industries, such as publishing with InDesign for typesetting, Photoshop for image editing, and tools like Audition and Premiere for sound and video editing. Adobe decided to stop selling products like Photoshop outright and moved to a subscription model, which is quite expensive. The annual subscription for Creative Cloud is nearly $700. While it's a business expense that we try to justify, it's still costly.

Not every company in this space follows this model. I now use DaVinci Resolve to edit my videos. DaVinci Resolve allows you to purchase a license once, and so far, I've received updates for every major release for free, without needing to repurchase the software. I think one day, Resolve might change its policy, but for now, it offers a more consumer-friendly model compared to Adobe's subscription approach. If you want new updates, you're going to need to pay $300 again, even if you purchased the license seven versions ago. been able to move beyond the need for ownership. However, the reality is that this shift towards subscriptions and digital rights management (DRM) is more about companies maintaining control over their products and ensuring a continuous revenue stream. 

For instance, with software like Adobe, once you stop subscribing, you lose access to the tools you need, such as Photoshop and Premiere. This model is extending beyond software into other industries, like printing and automobiles. Companies like HP and Brother are turning printers into subscription services, where even the toner can stop working if you cancel your subscription due to DRM.

In the automotive industry, luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes are leading the charge with subscription models. BMW requires a monthly fee to access features like heated seats, even if the hardware is already installed in the car. Mercedes offers "digital extras," such as an acceleration increase, which you can access by subscribing.

This trend suggests a move towards a post-ownership world, where the products you purchase are not entirely yours. The phrase "you will own nothing and be happy" comes from an article by the World Economic Forum, which has since been removed but can be accessed via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. The article discusses a future where abundance negates the need for ownership, but the current trajectory seems more focused on corporate control and profit. The idea of moving past ownership to a model where we rent things as needed is often portrayed as a way to improve our lives. While things are not free, they are at least freely available to anyone who needs them. When the writer imagines a future, perhaps in 2030 or 2035, where she owns nothing, it is an attempt to envision a more optimistic future. This vision reads almost like a utopian document, describing a world where nobody owns a car—not because cars are banned or require a subscription, but because public transportation is so efficient that owning a car is unnecessary.

However, the phrase "you will own nothing and be happy" has gained significant traction as an ironic catchphrase. It reflects a growing concern that we are moving towards a world where we own nothing, yet none of us are happy about it. This sentiment is echoed in the book "Technofeudalism" by Giannis Varoufakis. In the book, Varoufakis argues that we have moved past capitalism, where ownership of capital determines power, into what he calls "cloud capitalism" or "technofeudalism." Here, companies and those in power are primarily interested in extracting rent from us, similar to a feudal system. Instead of renting land, we rent access to the cloud or digital infrastructures essential for modern life.

While I am not entirely convinced by Varoufakis's framework, the book does highlight important issues. We are increasingly becoming perpetual renters, subscribing to services that traditionally would not require subscriptions. Even when we make a one-time payment, we often only receive a license, which can be revoked. Ownership is concentrated in the hands of corporations rather than individuals.

Imagine a world where you have to subscribe to your toaster, microwave, or oven. With the rise of smart devices, this scenario may not be far off. Initially, people laughed at the idea of subscribing to features in cars, but it has become a reality. Could you imagine Amazon eventually requiring a subscription to access books on your Kindle, even after purchase? Maybe that's not a good business decision for them, but I could see them at least considering it. What do we do? If we're being honest, we have to admit that there's not a lot any one person can do. I make videos about this topic and try to discuss it in depth, hoping to change some minds. However, my messaging has never changed Amazon's policies. There are a few things I do in my own life that you might want to try yourself. For instance, I've stopped buying digital content. The biggest change for me was stopping the purchase of books on my Kindle because I don't trust Amazon. I want to actually own the books I read, revisit them in the future, and leave them for my son, even if he doesn't want them.

Some people suggest switching to Kobo, but it has the same problems as Amazon. The terms of service are nearly identical regarding these issues. Switching from Kindle to Kobo isn't the answer. If you want to use an e-reader, find one that's more open. I think Books is a bit better, and you need to find a way to locally own your files, ensuring they don't have DRM, so you can do with them as you see fit.

Every time I've mentioned this, people ask how to do it. The problem is, I can't do tech tutorials. I'm really bad at it, and I hate explaining that kind of stuff. I don't understand the complexities enough. However, I have a link in the description to a playlist of videos that are essentially the best tutorials for things like using Books and DRM. Tech questions should be answered by that playlist. Of course, you don't need tech support if you just buy physical books, so if that's possible for you, I highly recommend pursuing that option instead.

Another thing is that there are larger political initiatives I encourage people to support. I don't talk about explicit politics, candidates, or political parties on this channel. I think it's more interesting to discuss issues and ideas. However, if you find an organization supporting the right to repair, this is one of the fronts in this ongoing battle. Organizations supporting the right to repair are trying to codify into law our abilities to repair, modify, and resell things we buy. There's a whole issue with farmers wanting to modify the software on their John Deere tractors and being unable to. You could imagine a world where farm equipment becomes a matter of subscriptions rather than ownership. This is part of a larger battle. I have donated in the past to organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is essentially a civil liberties organization for the digital world. Supporting the Right to Repair and the Electronic Frontier Foundation is a worthwhile cause. You should try to vote with your dollars as well. If a company sells you a printer and then requires a subscription to access it, even if it's a cheap subscription, do not buy that printer. If a company offers digital goods but denies you any rights of ownership, reconsider purchasing those goods. If you're looking for a new car and discover that the manufacturer wants to sell you a subscription for features like heated seats, don't buy that car. While this may seem like a small decision, your purchasing choices can make a difference. If you object to how a company treats you, stop giving them your money.

The world is facing many problems, and if you're someone who wants to make a difference, one way to do that is by pursuing a high-impact career. On average, you'll spend 80,000 hours working in your lifetime. Choosing the right career can be a great way to make a positive difference in the world.
