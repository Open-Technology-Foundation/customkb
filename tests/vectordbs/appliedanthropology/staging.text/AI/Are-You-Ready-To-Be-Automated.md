Automation is rapidly transforming industries and the workforce. As technology advances, many tasks traditionally performed by humans are now being handled by machines and algorithms. This shift raises important questions about the future of work and the role of humans in an increasingly automated world.

One of the key areas affected by automation is manufacturing, where robots and automated systems have taken over repetitive and dangerous tasks. This has led to increased efficiency and safety but also to concerns about job displacement. However, automation is not limited to manufacturing. It is also making significant inroads in sectors like healthcare, finance, and customer service.

In healthcare, AI-powered diagnostic tools are assisting doctors in identifying diseases more accurately and quickly. In finance, algorithms are used for trading and risk management, while in customer service, chatbots are handling routine inquiries, freeing up human agents for more complex issues.

The impact of automation on employment is a topic of much debate. While some fear massive job losses, others argue that automation will create new opportunities and roles that we cannot yet imagine. The key to thriving in an automated world is adaptability. Workers need to be open to learning new skills and embracing change.

Education and training systems must evolve to prepare individuals for the jobs of the future. This includes a focus on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education, as well as soft skills like critical thinking and emotional intelligence, which are harder to automate.

Ultimately, the question is not whether automation will happen, but how we can best prepare for it. By understanding the changes and being proactive in our approach, we can ensure that automation enhances our lives rather than diminishes them. Machines performing laborious and monotonous tasks to keep society functioning has been a dream since we first imagined a robot. Automation has come a long way, with machines capable of logical thinking becoming common on production lines worldwide. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, battery technology, and mechanical systems suggest that we may soon have machines capable of performing any task better than humans.

However, the idea of robots taking all our jobs has shifted from a utopian dream to a global concern. ChatGPT, though only two years old and still imperfect, has already influenced job allocation, academic integrity, and job searching. Predicting technological progress is risky, but businesses, governments, and individuals must adapt to achieve the ideal version of automation.

In some fulfillment centers, robotics usage is ten times higher than in others, allowing for 25% faster order processing. Amazon is now using drones for package delivery in the Phoenix Metro area. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that at least 42% of U.S. jobs are at high risk of automation. The IT department of every company may become the HR department for AI agents in the future.

To understand what full automation means for personal finances, consider that we are all born with a portfolio of assets, primarily the hours we trade for pay. According to estimates from the OECD and Gettysburg College, most people will sell between 80,000 and 90,000 hours of their life for money. For men, this number is closer to 100,000 hours, as they are generally less likely to take significant time off for family.

Even with a modest salary, these hours are worth over a million dollars. With the right skills, career moves, and networking, they could be worth much more. While it may be depressing to think of it this way, it highlights the importance of adapting to the changes automation brings. The majority of you watching should understand that your greatest asset is not your home, your share portfolio, or your PSA 10 Charizard. It's the hours of work you can sell over your lifetime. Anything you can do to improve the value of those hours—be it upskilling, voting for pro-worker policies, or just ensuring you're spending your valuable time well—should make you richer in the long term. This is especially true if you don't already have a huge portfolio of other assets or take on too much debt in the process.

Logically, anything that threatens the value of this asset should be alarming. A machine or program that can do all or even part of your job is such a threat. It's competition in the market for work that makes your own hours less competitive and therefore less valuable. A study by Pew Research found that 90% of American jobs were at the highest risk of automation from artificial intelligence. A similar study by Goldman Sachs found that only around 9% of jobs were at similar immediate risk globally, mainly because America has a higher proportion of service-based jobs.

The Pew Research study also found that people with higher levels of education were more at risk of being replaced because they are more likely to work in office jobs. It has turned out to be much easier to replace people inputting data into computers than those requiring real-world outputs from computer-operated machines. If 90% of jobs were to disappear within a decade, it would be devastating for people who still need to sell their time for money. There hasn't been a sustained drop in jobs that severe since we started collecting economic data. Even if you are one of the lucky ones who can hold onto a job, the market will be flooded with people who have lost theirs and will be willing to work for anything they can get. If your hours are your greatest asset, this would be the equivalent of a panic selling event.

Another important variable is your age. If you are younger, you have a larger holding of hours in your life to sell. As you age, you should statistically build up actual wealth with more typical investments. If you are broadly invested in the markets, some of your capital will go towards companies that will use it to invest in automation technology. Most of the biggest companies in the world are already investing hundreds of billions of dollars into AI technology. This means that wealthier, older people with more real investments will likely benefit from widespread automation, while younger people just starting out will be forced to compete with it.

To prepare for this, you might consider learning to work with your hands or striving to be independently wealthy. A more realistic solution might be to build a system where someone's value isn't entirely tied up in how many hours of work they have to sell. Long-term planning from both governments and businesses is required to adapt to the changes brought by automation and AI. Assuming we could get everyone on board, it's crucial to learn how this works to determine its viability.

Last week, Tesla held its earnings call following less than stellar sales and profit numbers. The company is valued like a high-growth entity, but its financials are starting to resemble those of a post-growth car company. The most attention-grabbing news was Elon Musk's return as a full-time CEO. However, the majority of the call focused on convincing shareholders that current car sales were irrelevant because the company's future lies in technologies like full self-driving taxis and the Optimus humanoid robot. Musk believes that Optimus will ultimately be worth more than the car business and more than full self-driving.

Creating a robot in the form of an adult human is extremely challenging, but if Tesla or another company succeeds, it offers significant advantages over typical commercial robot arms. The biggest benefit is that the world is designed for adult humans. Everything from screwdrivers to reception kiosks is made with human operators in mind. A humanoid robot could, in theory, use generic tools designed for humans instead of expensive custom parts that only work with specific machines. For example, if a humanoid robot's mop breaks, it could simply get a new one from a store like Home Depot. This means companies wouldn't need to design processes from scratch with automation in mind; they could replace humans with human-like machines. This approach could be crucial for those who will actually be purchasing these technologies. A standard six-axis industrial robot arm, like those seen in car assembly lines, costs tens of thousands of dollars each. This assumes you are willing to order advanced industrial equipment from a platform like Alibaba. Realistically, if you are a manufacturing executive setting up an automated production line, you will likely source your machines from a more established company. Once you purchase the individual arms, the control system, and installation, you are looking at a multi-million dollar investment at minimum.

Humanoid robots would not need to be customized for each use case, allowing them to be generically mass-produced in large volumes. Since they don't require a huge amount of materials, there is theoretically no reason why they couldn't be priced similarly to an entry-level car. According to Elon Musk, during Tesla's presentation, the company's humanoid Optimus robots will sell for between $20,000 and $30,000 once they go into production. Even at $100,000 per unit, these machines would present a compelling investment opportunity. If they replace someone earning the national average, they would pay for themselves in two years.

For Tesla, this is a great opportunity because brand reputation matters far less for business-to-business strategic acquisitions. Regardless of personal opinions about Elon Musk, other companies are primarily concerned with improving their bottom line. They would purchase tools from anyone if it benefited their business, assuming the technology works. Critics argue that while humanoid robots may sound appealing in theory, specialized machines will always be more cost-effective for most applications in the long run.

Even if it's just an investment bubble, there will be significant financial opportunities for any company that can bring a broadly capable humanoid robot to market. However, this presents a bigger problem for other companies worldwide. If automation makes everyone redundant, who will be left to sell to? I made a mistake when I covered this question in a video last year. I suggested that businesses should eventually shift their production offerings to cater exclusively to other businesses or wealthy asset owners who earn income from investments rather than exchanging hours for dollars. My mistake was that this is already happening. A report by Moody's Analytics found that the top 10% of households by income are now responsible for more than half of consumer spending in the economy, and this trend is increasing.

In the past, mechanization has made people more productive, and most of the world's population is richer today than at any point in history. Businesses have become more compassionate towards their workers because machines have made man-hours more productive and therefore more valuable. However, technology is now making workers redundant rather than more productive. Businesses can prepare by either moving upmarket with their products to appeal to asset owners or by going downmarket to extract what they can from people with no other options. Companies will do whatever they can to maximize profit for their shareholders, as this is their design. It's easy to anthropomorphize greedy companies and blame them for everything, but blaming a company for maximizing profit is like being angry at a deli slicer for not showing restraint on a haircut—it's not what they do. That responsibility should fall to governments, who theoretically represent the people who will be made redundant.

My old colleague, who now runs the channel Micro, made a great video about how mindlessly creating jobs for the sake of creating jobs might be popular politically, but it has made us ill-equipped to deal with changes like this when they present themselves. The most direct solution would be to ban the use of technology that could replace taxpayer jobs, but that would be extremely short-sighted. We have already seen the beginnings of this with the dock worker strikes that happened late last year. The strikes concluded with a tentative agreement that the ports would not introduce any automated machines that could take dock worker jobs. This was a union fighting for the best interest of their workers, which is exactly what they should do. However, long-term, it's hard for any group to fight the march of progress. You can't ban the internet, the car, or the light bulb just to keep librarians, horses, and lamplighters in business.

If we don't use advanced automation, other countries will, and international companies will just move their operations there instead. A better solution would be to encourage this technology but ensure that people benefit from it. Unfortunately, this technological shakeup is happening at a time when we can least fiscally afford it. Optimistic ideas about universal basic incomes or capital reallocation might work, but they will cost a lot of money—money that will be hard to get without significant new taxes. Unfortunately, the same people who stand to benefit the most from a fully automated future would also be the biggest targets for those taxes.

Major technological changes have always had a destabilizing impact on societies, from the steam engine to the internet. Combining that with an already unstable economy is very bad. To put it bluntly, this technology could give us a Jetson's future, but only if we are valued at more than the hours in our day. This is necessary because not only is AI getting smarter every day, but it might also be making us dumber. If we have already passed peak human intelligence, it raises the question of why the last two decades have seen us starting to go backwards.
