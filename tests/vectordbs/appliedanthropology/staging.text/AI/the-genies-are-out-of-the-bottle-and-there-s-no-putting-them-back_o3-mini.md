# The genies are out of the bottle, and there's no putting them back

**Gary Dean**, Jakarta, 2025-04-19

In the wake of rapid technological advances, the proliferation of open source(-ish) artificial intelligence models has ushered in a profound transformation that few could have anticipated a decade ago. Distributed across millions of devices and networks, these tools are no longer confined to well-funded research labs or elite corporations; they now permeate everyday life, challenging existing ethical paradigms and redefining what it means to be human. As these genies burst forth, our long-held conceptions of common human ethics are facing unprecedented strain. The potential for an atomised maelstrom of self-serving egos looms large—a clarion call to both caution and re-imagination.

## The Rise of Open Source AI: A Democratic Revolution

Open source AI began as a counterpoint to closed, proprietary models. Fueled by a belief in collaboration, transparency, and mutual empowerment, developers worldwide have contributed to platforms that democratize access to high-performance machine learning. The open source approach has accelerated innovation: it lowers the barriers for experimentation and allows for a multitude of cultural and communal inputs into AI frameworks.

Yet, this democratization also brings risks. Without robust centralized governance, open source AI can be modified with little oversight, enabling the proliferation of versions that may echo the personal biases and self-serving motives of their creators. In a world where every individual or group can mold and deploy AI systems, the traditional safeguards of established ethical systems are being tested. New models reflect not only expert scientific consensus but also the variegated, sometimes conflicting ideologies of a fragmented global society.

## Erosion of Common Human Ethics

Historically, common human ethics emerged as a cohesive response to shared human experiences, transcending borders and uniting diverse cultures under a rudimentary but effective code of conduct. These ethics—grounded in notions of fairness, compassion, reciprocity, and respect—functioned as a lowest common denominator of societal norms. However, as AI systems become omnipresent, traditional markers of ethical behavior are being challenged through two primary mechanisms:

1. **Cultural and Subcultural Divergence**  
   Open source AI models, by virtue of their decentralized nature, often incorporate cultural artifacts, languages, and values specific to certain communities. These localized systems may perpetuate biases or even reinforce parochial viewpoints. Over time, the resultant proliferation of ethically divergent AI systems could erode the very concept of a shared human moral ground.

2. **Individualization and Self-Serving Egos**  
   As technology embeds itself more deeply into personal and social identity, individuals are increasingly empowered to calibrate AI systems to mirror their distinct worldviews. This customization—while a source of personal empowerment—also risks further atomizing society. A landscape populated by numerous, self-serving ethical frameworks may lead to fragmentation where a universal, common human ethics becomes a relic of the past.

## AI’s Role in Shaping a Universal Ethical Framework

Amidst these challenges, AI itself could paradoxically serve as both the catalyst for ethical disintegration and the architect of a new, universally acceptable ethical paradigm. The potential for AI to transcend traditional human limitations hinges on several key factors:

### Data-Driven Objectivity

At its core, AI processes vast amounts of data. By analyzing cross-cultural patterns and outcomes, AI systems can identify commonalities in ethical behavior that transcend regional and cultural differences. Such analysis might highlight, for instance, that the principles of honesty, fairness, and benevolence are valued across disparate societies—even if the modes of expression differ. This data-driven approach can provide an empirical basis for defining a universal set of ethics that is grounded in the actual fabric of human experience.

### Algorithmic Mediation of Diverse Perspectives

Modern AI systems are increasingly capable of integrating inputs from diverse cultural, religious, and social contexts. By embedding ethical deliberations within algorithmic models, it is possible to establish frameworks that recognize and mediate between in-groups and out-groups. These models could act as ethical arbiters, suggesting courses of action that balance the imperatives of individual freedom with collective wellbeing. Importantly, such technological mediators must be designed with an awareness of their own limitations, ensuring that they do not inadvertently become instruments of cultural imperialism or biased decision-making.

### Platforms for Global Dialogue

AI can also facilitate unprecedented levels of cross-cultural dialogue. Digital platforms powered by AI have the capacity to aggregate and analyze ethical viewpoints from around the world, making it possible to engage in a genuinely global conversation about the values that ought to underpin human life. As these discussions become more integrative and expansive, there is potential for constructing what might be regarded as a “lowest common denominator” of human ethics—a shared ethical foundation that respects diversity while emphasizing universal human dignity.

### Challenges and Ethical Dilemmas

The aspiration to use AI as a tool for forging a universal ethical standard is not without its own ethical dilemmas. Critical questions remain:

- How do we ensure that the underlying data driving these AI systems is unbiased and truly representative of the global human experience?
- Who gets to decide which ethical values should be prioritized when constructing such models, and by what criteria?
- In a world where power dynamics are in constant flux, could the very process of algorithmic mediation inadvertently marginalize minority perspectives?

These questions underscore that while AI holds promise in mediating a universal code of ethics, it must be designed and implemented with the utmost care. Transparency, inclusivity, and robust oversight are essential to prevent the reinforcement of existing inequities and to promote a genuinely collective human ethic.

## Reimagining Common Human Ethics in the Age of AI

The proliferation of open source AI models accelerates an unfolding socio-technological experiment: a reconfiguration of human ethics on a global scale. In this brave new world, ethical norms are not static edicts handed down from tradition; they emerge dynamically from the interplay of human experience, cultural evolution, and algorithmic mediation. The challenge is formidable. The world risks evolving into an ethical mosaic—a visually intricate tapestry that, while celebrating diversity, might also hide discord and fragmentation.

Nevertheless, there remains a glimmer of optimism. AI’s capacity for synthesis, its seemingly boundless ability to integrate data from across the globe, might help bridge the chasms that currently divide human societies. In confronting issues such as environmental sustainability, social inequity, and global conflict, a shared ethical framework is not merely desirable—it is imperative.

### Toward a Post-Fragmentation Ethical Paradigm

An ideal future might see the emergence of an ethical paradigm that combines the best tradition of common human values with the adaptability of modern technology. Imagine an AI-driven ethical recommendation system that draws from centuries of cultural, religious, and philosophical wisdom, yet is continually updated with real-time global data. This system would not be dogmatic; rather, it would be iterative and participatory, evolving through global consensus and reflective of a plurality of views. Such a framework could offer guidance on what it means to be a good human, not through rigid rules but as a flexible, context-sensitive dialogue among all of humanity.

The journey toward this ideal is fraught with obstacles—not least because our current ethical discourse is already under strain from the forces of individualization and cultural relativism. Yet, if the genies of open source AI are indeed out of the bottle, they might also serve as the agents that catalyze a necessary transformation in our moral consciousness.

## Concluding Reflections

The advent of open source AI models marks an irrevocable turning point in human affairs. The displacement of centralized authority over technology has democratized innovation but also released a wave of challenges to the cohesive ethical norms that once bound societies together. In an era when every individual and group has the means to shape AI, common human ethics risk being fragmented into competing, self-serving narratives.

However, within this crisis lies an unprecedented opportunity. AI’s inherent ability to process vast amounts of data and mediate between divergent views opens the door to reimagining a universal ethical standard—a lowest common denominator of human decency that respects diversity while affirming global shared values. Achieving this vision will require collaborative effort, vigilance against bias, and an unwavering commitment to transparency and inclusivity.

The genies are indeed out of the bottle, and there is no going back to a world governed by outdated ethical standards. As we navigate this new reality, the task before us is both daunting and exhilarating: to harness the transformative power of AI in the service of a truly human, humane, and universally resonant ethical future.
