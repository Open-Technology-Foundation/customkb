**Truths and Tasks: the finger that becomes the moon**

The four noble truths and the four tasks are two concepts that
contradict each other for certain reasons. The first of these concerns
the way in which they are formulated: the four truths correspond to the
need to create a structure of thought that refers to a general
regulatory framework. This happens every time that philosophical,
intellectual, human research is transformed into a system of thought
that claims to be eternal, not to change with time and to be valid
always and in any case for everyone. Therefore, what is born as a
research tool is transformed into research itself. It is the finger that
becomes the moon. In this diagram, questions are no longer counted, but
only answers. Because such a pattern of thought has as its function the
function of providing that kind of answers capable of being sufficiently
reliable reference points to counteract the incompleteness, impermanence
and imperfection of human experience. In the scheme that is based on
truth, what is imperfect becomes perfect, what is a threat is tamed,
what is impermanent becomes eternal. In other words, it is taken away
from the very laws of nature to become its founding principle. The law
itself. The engine, the principle, the justification, the necessity, the
boundary within which everything can and must happen. Beyond this
horizon there is nothing, nothing is granted, nothing finds citizenship.
What is different is excluded or combated. In the best hypothesis
tolerated as an extravagance and brought back, domesticated, to the
logic of truth itself as a demonstration of its perfection.

**The perfection of truth**

The more it succeeds in normalizing these inconsistencies, weakening
their critical spirit, research and authenticity, the more perfect the
truth is. Truth is the opposite of art, creativity, freedom and life. It
is like a laboratory tube with an inert material inside, placed on the
slide to be examined under the microscope lens and catalogued in
subschemes suitable to provide explanations for individual needs,
questions. To provide instruments that make "clear", always in the
logic of dogmatism, not the spirit and motives of research, but its
conclusions. The truth starts at the end and goes back to the beginning
so that this beginning is coherent with the whole structure. And every
element that is not part of this process becomes an externality. We see
it clearly in the economy. Economic research, at the moment in which it
began to abandon the philosophical field, that is, that of hypotheses
and research, in order to become doctrine first and then "science",
has embarked on this process of assimilation and exclusion. Assimilation
of all the elements that could guarantee objectivity, such as
statistical data and mathematical principles, in order to abandon or
consider as spurious, externalities, all those social phenomena that did
not respond to a typically "economic" behaviour. A doctrine needs
clear, defined, immutable principles that become the foundation of its
indisputability. Of one's own religiosity, understood not as an
attitude of the spirit, but as dogma beyond the spirit, beyond time,
beyond space.

**The closing of the circle**

To this end, the four noble truths respond as well, which are the
foundation of Buddhist doctrine first and then of the Buddhist religion.
An instrument of guidance, identity, transmission of a picture of
values, ideas, opposing positions (not in dialogue) with as many
different systems of thought. When idealism began to make its way in
ancient Greece, first with Plato and then with Aristotle, the same
phenomenon occurred: that patrimony of research, introspection, wisdom,
so deeply human and immanent represented by all philosophy up to a
certain number, was first criticized, then mocked and disassembled,
until considering it not even worthy of being counted under the name of
philosophy. The idealism that starts from Plato and goes as far as Kant,
has served this purpose: to create a system of thought that can explain
reality. Paradoxically regardless of reality itself. And it is precisely
for this reason that Platonism and Aristotelianism have become so
indissoluble with what was Paul of Tarsus' brilliant and equally
authoritarian intuition. Philosophy, so understood, provided the perfect
basis for justifying the dogma of a spiritual as well as intellectual
absolute. It was the closing of the circle. The moral part of Christian
philosophy and doctrine then spoke to the spirit, the rational part
spoke to the intellect and supported the dogma, and constituted its
logical and eschatological basis. The extreme consequences of this
journey begun in post-Socratic Athens have reached the totalitarianism
of the 20th century, including Catholicism, passing through Hegel, their
main inspiring devotee.

**Looking for new horizons**

A march that crashes against Nietzsche first and then Heidegger and
against all the existentialism and literary and artistic production of
the last century. Where, faced with the defeats that the perfect design
of any matrix suffers in history, a new need for a place for humanity as
such resurfaces powerfully, rather than for an idea of humanity. The end
of totalitarianism and the retreat of the Christian cultural and power
model open the way to new forms of research. Turning attention to Dharma
and other forms of oriental religiosity in the contemporary world is
part of this perspective: modern man feels uneasiness towards
traditional forms of religiosity, as well as the oriental one, to say
the truth. Look for new horizons that can guide their steps in a society
that is everything but canonized. In Europe of the past centuries
magic/religious thought dominated. Europeans were truly convinced of the
existence of presences such as spirits, fairies or elves. And they took
it for granted that the model of the world was the one that had taken
root in the common imaginary, so rampant that it influenced even the
learned vision of the world. People and intellectuals were united by the
same vision of the world and the same values. Montaigne himself, in his
Essays, while deeply feeling the need to live with his own existential
discomfort and to understand its meaning, refuses, when he moves on a
social level, to accept any kind of reform of the dominant order. Plan
of the real and metaphysical plane, in the ancient world dominated by
Christian theology, end up coinciding. And this partnership is so strong
that it takes centuries of upheavals and revolutions to bring man, with
his fragility and incompleteness, back to the centre of the scene.

**Metaphysics**

every system of thought based on truth, of any kind, develops on the
level of metaphysics. Basically, it lays its foundations out of reality
and immanence. The body, physicality, time and space experienced and
incarnated in the body, are bent as a transit function towards an
objective that is beyond the present, beyond this time, beyond this
immanence. Indeed, this time, this immanence, is an obstacle if it does
not become functional to the general scheme of metaphysics. The
metaphysical system is the one able to produce answers for each type of
question. Answers, in theory, indisputable, perfect. But when an unease
begins to arise within human consciousness, an dissatisfaction with the
imaginary picture created by metaphysical thought, the ball returns to
the research field. The questions are beginning to be more urgent than
the answers. The most important method of results. Primary experience
with ideas. The most urgent process towards the goal. The perspective is
reversed. We move from what is considered ultimate in a general scheme,
shared, codified, to what becomes ultimate for individual, intimate and
lonely experience. Where loneliness is not separation but the condition
to immerse oneself in the world at a level of "connection", let's
say, that social noise does not make possible. Man does not isolate
himself but digs deep into himself in order to re-emerge and then build
a dialogue with the other who is even more authentically, deeply human.
There is no dissolution of social or refuge, escape into the staff. The
two levels are not in contradiction, as other metaphysical theories
would like them to be.

**An ultimate concern based ethics**

On the contrary, the rediscovery of what is ultimate on a personal level
is the only primary condition for creating a more authentic
relationship. To a shared ethics. Where man exists in function of this
relationship, between fully expressed human beings. It is the
commonality of the human condition that creates solidarity and
identification. Fragility, the acceptance of the human condition, become
the viaticus for the understanding and inclusion of others in their own
path. Therefore, if in the metaphysical scheme there is the
nullification of individual destiny in the name of a greater
perspective, and moved elsewhere, in a time after which it never comes
to fruition, in the ethical pact there is the rediscovery, the
revaluation of the present, of the human condition, exactly for what it
is. In this perspective that is based on the method, on research, on a
bet, starting from truths with which to relate, to which modelling
becomes essentially useless. There is no need for external truths to
support our research, because research in itself, experiment, immersion
in reality are the only condition that is given to live and the only
dimension of experience with which to deal. We do not need an authority
to tell us what is right or wrong, because the right and wrong are
replaced by adequate or no answers to the conditions and circumstances.
What is right is transformed into what is appropriate. In the ethical
pact, at the moment of stipulation, not a truth but an availability is
put on the table. Not a knowledge but a lack of knowledge. Not an a
priori vision but the bet to look together where this vision will take
us. You put on the table confrontation, listening, dialogue, experience.
We are starting from there not from the premises. It moves from the
perspective of possibility, betting, risk, getting your hands dirty,
compromising yourself with living matter, bodily, pulsating, immanent.

**The ethical pact and the four tasks**

In the ethical pact there is no room for absolute, understood as theory,
because everything is already "absolute", the absolute present. And
the theories about absolute are overcome by life and its experience. On
the contrary, the four "tasks" form a direct part of this process. The
four tasks are job prospects, platforms for meeting and comparison.
Challenges, opportunities to know each other and get to know each other
and constitute the basis and the premises for the realization of the
ethical pact. They are a "contract" that is stipulated with reality
and with others. And the contract is based on remaining open, welcoming
experiences, as well as people, from a perspective of lack of knowledge
and judgment. Moreover, they are a path to experiment, of which we
don't know the landing place, because the way is outlined by the way
and where the research methods, far from being a boundary, is rather a
perspective, a "taste", a support and a stimulus. Embracing life,
rather than believing in the truth of suffering, leaves open the door to
the opportunity to ask, to experience, to immerse oneself in life itself
and to grasp what, in this life, represents what for us is truly
ultimate. We are not given. It is not predetermined. But we can be
surprised, we can grasp the sublime, with a freshness, a completeness
and also a confidence, which dogma will never allow. We can wear this
experience, let it enter our daily lives, modify it and let it change as
we make our way. The tasks, understood in this way, are a bit like the
director's plot that is modified by the interaction with the actors.
Each time differently. They are like the painter's canvas where the
practice, which in this case really becomes the art of living, draws its
own colours. And the time plan also changes. The tasks are to be put
into action now, just as life is to be lived now. Not in an "after",
in a temporal and psychological eschatological and elitist horizon. They
are not the prize for the end of the race, but a road to take starting
from the moment. The four tasks are the context in which to give
expression and concreteness to that life lived in the perspective of
care and not dominated by reactivity. It is that change of perspective
that allows us to say that nirvana is now. Because nirvana is the most
authentic human condition.

**Embracing dukkha**

Recently in Veneto (north of Italy) a group of doctors from a hospital
were faced with a very complex decision: a young motorcyclist had been
taken into emergency hospital in a coma state for a serious accident.
After several attempts to save his life, the surgeon's team realizes
that the only intervention that could be a solution is not only not
included in the hospital protocol but is even forbidden because of its
high danger. It would also have been the first time ever that such a
technique would have been attempted. After consultation with the boy's
parents, the doctors decide to risk and proceed. After a long operation
and a few hours of waiting time, the young person wakes up without any
major damage. A true "miracle". The news circulates the media and
doctors receive solidarity and messages from all over the country. This
is certainly a classic episode with a happy ending. Probably more unique
than rare. But how would it have been if these surgeons had acted only
on the basis of rules, protocols, what was "right" to do, what is
commonly established and accepted? What would have happened to the young
person if, faced with such a dramatic choice, they had overcome logic,
prudence, compliance with the norm, perhaps even fear of endangering
careers and certainties? Instead, something else prevailed. Faced with
the urgent need to save a life, a connection has been established with
the sense of humanity that unites us all. There was no longer a just and
a wrong one. There was one way to go and it was travelled, a chance to
seize and it was seized. The doctors acted first of all as people,
faithful to their duty to protect life before anything else. Always.

**Which is the "right thing" in a tasks perspective?**

The question, at this point, is: how would I behave if I found myself in
a similar situation that seems like a deadlock, which calls into
question every certainty to the point of not seeing a way out except to
surrender? In situations such as these, when you are personally
involved, does the good of one or many more matter? Do children come
first? Before young people or the elderly? What life does it deserve
more than another? And if I don't have to "embrace Dukkha" because
it's a bigger problem than me? None of these choices has consequences.
Often, the answer "we feel" is so urgent that it leaves us no
alternative. It is as if our body, our "instinct" tells us what to do.
This perspective means granting ourselves the freedom from
preconceptions, fixed ideas, convictions that do not allow us to
"feel" the other, to make him part of our own experience and do not
allow us to bear witness to what there is, concretely, here and now. The
fixed, discounted, pre-established schemes do not leave room for
knowledge or encounter, but they lead us to drizzle In general, I
believe that what favours this freedom, this sharing, this connection
and does not hinder the process of living is to be pursued. Wise not
right, compassionate not true. What favours the aridity of the spirit,
the chains, the denial of freedom is good to avoid it. In this
"fluidity", even in the possibility of saying "yes" under extreme
conditions, in this process lies the opportunity for freedom of every
human being. That is a freedom of wisdom and experience at the same
time. The body shows us our limits and puts us in touch with the
condition of others. That is the same as ours and that leaves us no
other way but to share this transience, this not being perfect that
unites us all and represents us. It was in this way, looking at the
situation with compassion, awareness and humanity, that Veneto doctors
acted. And I believe that this is the only possible way to embrace life,
to welcome what is there, to give in to the situation. The life of the
motorcyclist has become theirs. His salvation, after all, has become the
real possibility of showing to themselves how much they could be fully
human.
