**Three Metaphors**

1\. The Raft

2\. The Arrow

3\. The City

**1. The Raft**

The power of metaphor and parable: the imagination, indicative of an
early origin

The raft as a metaphor of leaving home and embracing the solitude of
homelessness

"Suppose, monks, a man in the course of a journey saw a great expanse of
water, whose near shore was dangerous and fearful and whose further
shore was safe and free from fear, but there was no ferryboat or bridge
going to the far shore. Then he thought: 'suppose I collect grass,
twigs, branches and leaves and bind them together as a raft, and
supported by the raft and making an effort with my hands and feet, I got
safely across to the far shore.' ... Having arrived at the far shore, he
might think thus: 'This raft has been very helpful to me, suppose I were
to hoist it on my head or load it on my shoulder, then go wherever I
want.' Now, monks, what do you think? By doing so, would that man be
doing what should be done with the raft?"

"No, venerable sir."

"By doing what would that man be doing what should be done with the
raft? Having arrived at the far shore, he might think thus: 'This raft
has been very helpful to me, suppose I were to haul it onto the dry land
or set it adrift in the water, and then go wherever I want.' Now, monks,
it is by so doing that the man would be doing what should be done with
that raft. So I have shown you how the dhamma is similar to a raft,
being for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of grasping.

"Monks, when you know the dhamma to be similar to a raft, you should
abandon even good states (*dhamma*), how much more so bad states
(*adhamma*)." \[M 22, i. 135, p. 228-9.\]

Embrace the situation, let go of what holds you back, seeing the
freedom, acting by making a raft, then letting go of the raft to have
the freedom to continue the journey

The social and political circumstances of the Buddha's time: monks,
soldiers, merchants alone in the world: the Dharma is for everyone

Renunciation as the precondition for embarking on an ethical life

Taking refuge: like becoming a refugee

The refugee, the migrant. Hope and optimism, not only despair and
suffering

Life as a continual process of overcoming obstacles: Mara.

Riverbank situations: Caring for an aging parent, writing a book,
leading a retreat, overcoming depression

The dharma and sangha as provisional: a means not an end

Becoming independent of others when you enter the stream

Let no two of you follow the same path

**Instruction 1**

Raft as metaphor of four tasks: embracing the riverbank situation,
letting go of fears etc, settling into a still space, seeing what to do,
imagining a solution, enacting it with effort and mindfulness and
concentration, then letting go of the raft and getting on with your
life.

Letting go of reactivity

Compulsive, habitual, repetitive, self-indulgent, anxious, frustrated
emotions and thoughts

The woman on the train.

**2. The Arrow**

Wrong-minded people do voice opinions

as do truth-minded people too.

When an opinion is stated, the sage is not drawn in --

there's nothing arid about the sage.

Dropping one, you clutch the next --

urged ahead by self concern

you reject and adopt opinions

as a monkey lets go of a branch and seizes another.

One who dwells in "ultimate" views

and presents them as final

will declare all other views "inferior" --

he has not overcome disputes.

The sage lets go of one position without taking another --

he's not defined by what he knows.

Nor does he join a dissenting faction --

he assumes no view at all.

Embrace what you see and cross the flood.

The sage is untied to possessions --

having extracted the arrow, take care --

Don\'t long for this world or the next.

Dharma as pragmatic, sceptical therapy

No need for metaphysical certainties as a foundation for one's practice

Dharma is first and foremost a response to suffering

Malunkyaputta Sutta

\[Malunkyaputta:\] "The Buddha does not declare these to me, and I do
not approve of and accept the fact that he does not declares these to
me. Only if he declares to me either 'the world is eternal' or 'the
world is not eternal' etc, then I will lead the spiritual life under
him. If he does not, then I will abandon the training."

\[Buddha:\] "Suppose, Malunkyaputta, a man were wounded by an arrow
thickly smeared with poison, and his friends brought a surgeon to treat
him. The man would say: 'I will not let the surgeon pull out this arrow
until I know the name and clan of the man who wounded me; until I know
whether the man who wounded me was tall or short or of medium height;
until I know whether the man who wounded me was dark or brown or golden
skinned; until I know whether the man who wounded me lives in such a
village or town or city; until I know whether the bow that wounded me
was a long bow or a crossbow; until I know whether the bowstring that
wounded me was fibre or reed or sinew or hemp or bark; until I know
whether the shaft that wounded me was wild or cultivated; until I know
with what kind of feathers the shaft that wounded me was fitted --
whether those of a vulture or a crow or a hawk or a peacock or a stork;
until I know what kind of arrow it was that wounded me -- whether it was
hoof-tipped or curved or barbed or calf-toothed or oleander.

"All this would still not be known to that man and meanwhile he would
die. So, too, Malunkyaputta, if anyone should say: 'I will not lead the
spiritual life under the Buddha until the Buddha declares to me, 'the
world is eternal' etc., that would still remain undeclared by the Buddha
and meanwhile that person would die.

"Therefore, Malunkyaputta, remember what I have left undeclared as
undeclared, and remember what I have declared as declared.

"And what have I declared? 'This is dukkha' -- I have declared. 'This is
the origin of suffering' -- I have declared. 'This is the ceasing of
suffering' -- I have declared. This is the path leading to the cessation
of suffering' -- I have declared.

I do not declare these things. I declare the 4NT. But the 4NT are
metaphysical propositions too. The Sutta gives the impression that the
Buddha teaches metaphysics, but the right kind of metaphysics. Cf. the
Mahayana answered these questions. Following the parable, the point
surely must be that he presents a sequence of therapeutic tasks to
perform not a set of propositions to believe.

The Dharma is about know-how not know-that.

Sunnakhatta Sutta offers a detailed account of the "operation"

This operation is achieved by applying the probe of mindfulness and the
scalpel of wisdom as taught by the surgeon. It is possible, however,
that If the operation fails to remove every last trace of the poison,
and

the doctor has to instruct his the patient to take great care in diet
and hygiene so that the wound heals and does not get infected and heals.
But if the patient ignores these instructions, then "the wound would
swell, and with its swelling he would incur death or deadly suffering."
One may succeed in

extracting the arrow of reactivity with mindfulness and wisdom, thus
momentarily experiencing nirvana. But without being completely dedicated
to nirvana such a person may become complacent and careless, which leads
him once more to indulgence in those habits of mind that lead to an
inner death and despair. The Buddha goes one step further. Even when the
surgeon succeeds in removing every last trace of poison from the wound,
the patient is still instructed to "eat only suitable food; do not eat
unsuitable food or else the wound may suppurate. From time to time wash
the wound and anoint its opening so that pus and blood do not cover it.
Do not walk in the wind or sun or dirt may infect the wound. For if the
patient fails to take proper care of the wound, it could still get
infected and lead to suffering and death."

The arrow is "craving" but the removal of the arrow (nirvana) is not the
goal

The goal is to get well again in order to flourish as a person in the
world

Repeat the verses above as conclusion.

**Instruction 2**

Cupid's arrow, kamadeva, Mara's armies,

Cupid is winged, allegedly, because lovers are flighty and likely to
change their minds, and boyish because love is irrational. His symbols
are the arrow and torch, \"because love wounds and inflames the heart."

Cupid carries two kinds of arrows, or darts, one with a sharp golden
point, and the other with a blunt tip of lead. A person wounded by the
golden arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire, but the one struck by
the lead feels aversion and desires only to flee.

To be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether \'tis nobler in the
mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take
arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them?

Pierced by a foreign object, an autonomous complex in the psyche,
painful, losing one's lifeblood, one's vitality

The arrow impedes us from flourishing (reactivity blocks the path)

Removing the arrow is done by mindfully and intelligently understanding
reactivity - I know you Māra. And then consciously living a healthy
life.

Opinions are also arrows, snares, entanglements, drugs, toxins

Questioning as a remedy for opinions, emptiness as a letting go of views

Scepticism: open minded inquiry, quest for truth with no certainty of
ever finding it - to say there is no truth is the kind of opinion one
seeks to avoid

What is this?

I don\'t know.

**3. The City**

Crossing a river with a raft is part of a journey where we might be
wounded by an arrow on our way to the city.

The parable of the city

"Suppose, monks, a man wandering through a forest would see an ancient
path, an ancient road travelled upon by people in the past. He would
follow it and would see an ancient city, an ancient capital that had
been inhabited by people in the past, with parks, groves, ponds and
ramparts, a delightful place. Then the man would inform the king or a
royal minister: 'Sire, know that while wandering through the forest I
saw an ancient path, an ancient road travelled upon by people in the
past. I followed it and saw an ancient city, an ancient capital that had
been inhabited by people in the past, with parks, groves, ponds and
ramparts, a delightful place. Renovate that city, Sire!' Then the king
or royal minister would renovate the city, and some time later that city
would become successful and prosperous, well populated, filled with
people, attained to growth and expansion.

"So too, monks, I saw the ancient path, the ancient road travelled by
the Fully Awakened Ones of the past. And what is that ancient path, that
ancient road? It is just this noble eightfold path; that is: right
vision, thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness,
concentration. I followed that path and by doing so I have directly
known dukkha, the arising, the ceasing, and the way, as well as the
conditioned arising of dukkha. Having directly known them, I have
explained them to the monks, the nuns, the male lay followers, and
female lay followers. This good life, monks, has become successful and
prosperous, extended, popular, widespread, well proclaimed among devas
and humans. \[S. 12:65, pp. 603-4.\]

A reference to the Indus valley civilisation? Indraprashtra? Cf.
Montaigne and the ruins of the ancient world

Eight fold path as the framework for a civilisation, a civic society.

Vision, imagination, communication, action, work, application,
mindfulness, integration: the areas of human life to be integrated.

A society governed by the rule of law

A walled city as a metaphor for nirvana: a non-reactive space governed
by the Dharma

Mindfulness as the gatekeeper

Nirvana as an inner city: Marcus Aurelius - the inner citadel.

The kingdom of heaven is within you

Be islands to yourselves, your self as an island, dharma as an island

Cf. lamp

To become independent of others

**Instruction 3**

Seeing the stopping of reactivity : when the noise of a frig stops you
notice the silence for a few moments then are drawn away by something
that catches your attention. My mother and cataracts.

*Nirvana for Everyone* - Ajahn Buddhadasa

Nirvana : clearly visible, immediate, inviting, uplifting, felt by the
wise

Dwelling in emptiness

"In knowing and seeing thus, his heart is freed from the influences of
cupidity, becoming and nescience. In this freedom, the insight dawns:
'this is freedom.'

" 'With none of the anxieties due to those influences, I am prone to the
amount of anxiety that comes from having the six sense fields of a
living body.'

" 'This state of awareness is empty of those influences. That which is
not empty is this: the six sense fields of a living body.'

"So he regards it as empty of what is not there. And of what remains, he
knows: 'this is what's here.' So is this entry into emptiness in accord
with what happens, undistorted and pure.
