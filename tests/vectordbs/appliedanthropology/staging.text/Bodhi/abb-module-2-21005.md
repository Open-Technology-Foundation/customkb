# After Buddhism and Beyond

In classical terminology, the fourfold task is this:

>	Suffering (dukkha) is to be comprehended (parififia)
>	Arising (Samudaya) is to be let go of (pahana)
>	Ceasing (nirodha) is to be beheld (sacchikata)
>	Path (magga) is to be cultivated (bhavana)

In more colloquial language, it can be summarized as a set of injunctions:

>	Embrace life,
>	Let go of what arises,
>	See its ceasing,
>	Act!

Suffering (dukkha) is to be comprehended (parififa)

As the first step in practicing this fourfold task, Gotama encourages comprehension:
parifna, literally: “total knowing”. The prefix pari (“total”) denotes “around, round about, all
round, i.e. completely, altogether.”! Such “knowing” is not concerned with the acquisition
of knowledge about anything specific, but with a holistic comprehension of the total
situation in which one finds oneself at a given moment. It requires considering one’s
situation from a range of different angles and perspectives. Here is the classical definition
of dukkha:

	birth is dukkha, ageing is dukkha, sickness is dukkha, death is dukkha,
	encountering what is not dear is dukkha, separation from what is dear is dukkha,
	not getting what one wants is dukkha. In short, these five bundles of clinging are
	dukkha.

Since parififia embraces “birth, sickness, aging and death,” then such
comprehension is clearly existential in nature. It is fully aware of having been thrown into
this world at birth, being constantly subject to illness and breakdown, and each breath
being potentially your last. It is also unsentimental and realistic: it recognizes that this is a
world in which you keep meeting what you do not like, losing what you cherish, and failing
to get what you desire. And it is comprehensive: it includes every aspect of your sensory
world — what you see, hear, smell, taste and touch — as well as your subjective reception of
and response to this world: your feelings, perceptions, inclinations, and consciousness —
i.e. the “five bundles of clinging.”$

If, according to its canonical definition, dukkha denotes such an extensive range of
experience, then “suffering” is clearly an inadequate and misleading translation. When the
puzzled Licchavi nobleman Mahali asked Gotama whether he meant that life was
suffering, this was the reply:

	If, Mahali, forms, feelings, perceptions, inclinations and consciousness were
	exclusively suffering (dukkha), immersed in suffering, steeped in suffering, and if
	they were not also steeped in pleasure (Ssukha), beings would not become
	enamored of them. But because these things are pleasurable, beings become
	enamored of them. By being enamored of them, they are captivated by them, and
	by being captivated by them they are afflicted (sankilissanti).4

Mahdli failed to grasp what was different about Gotama’s teaching. He assumed, as many
would doubtless assume today, that the Buddha was talking from the “enlightened”
standpoint of someone who has gained a “correct” understanding of the nature of things.
This passage shows that the Buddha had no interest in presenting an accurate description
that corresponds to what reality is. He is not a metaphysician or ontologist. He wants
people to start paying attention to features of their experience that they habitually overlook
or ignore. His reason for doing this is entirely pragmatic: by not paying heed to the tragic
dimension of life, we become enamored, seduced and captivated by what is merely
agreeable, which leads to cycles of reactive and addictive behavior that keep us trapped,
frustrated and “afflicted.” Comprehension, by contrast, encompasses the totality of what
is happening: it is to embrace a life that is permeated equally by pain and pleasure,
suffering and joy.

To open one’s eyes to the whole picture requires that one suspend dogmatic
Buddhist beliefs such as “life is suffering” or “craving is the origin of suffering” and open
oneself to the ambiguity, uncanniness and ineffability of life as it reveals itself and
withdraws from moment to moment.

On numerous occasions we find Gotama comparing the practice of the dharma to
the skilled activity of a laborer or artisan. We saw how he likened the practitioner to a
farmer irrigating a field, a fletcher fashioning an arrow, a carpenter shaping a piece of
wood.> In another passage, he instructs his followers to develop concentration (samadhi),
exertion (paggaha) and equanimity (upekkha) like “a goldsmith would prepare a furnace,
heat up the crucible, take some gold with tongs, and put it into the crucible. From time to
time he would blow on it, from time to time sprinkle water over it, and from time to time just
look on.”6 He compares the person who practices mindful breathing to “a skilled wood-
turner,” who “when making a long turn understands ‘I’m making a long turn,’ and when
making a short turn understands ‘I’m making a short turn.”” He likens the meditator who
analyses the elements of his body to a “skilled butcher who has killed a cow and is seated
at a crossroads cutting it into pieces.”8 The Buddha admires how artisans have mastered
the skills they employ so effortlessly and effectively. To master the dharma likewise
requires more than just gaining a theoretical knowledge of its teaching. In order to practice
it you need to cultivate a know-how.

To embrace life with comprehension involves how we cope with our world. It has
more to do with how we get about, deal with conflicts, realize possibilities, engage with
others than acquiring knowledge of the nature of the mind or reality. Such comprehension
is not that of an aloof subject but is embedded in a culture, a language, a society, not to
mention a flesh and blood body that inhales and exhales, drinks and eats, pisses and
shits.

The kind of knowing entailed in parifiha may, therefore, be more akin to the French
connaitre than savoir, or the German kennen than wissen. It is comparable to the ways in
which we know a person, a piece of music, a path or a town. Such comprehension comes
from living or working with someone, spending many seasons in a landscape, or slowly
gaining an appreciation of a work of art. To comprehend dukkha is to comprehend life
intimately and ironically with all its paradoxes and quirks, its horror and jokes, its sublimity
and banality. As we saw in the exchange between the Buddha and Mahanama at
Bharandu’s lodging, this comprehension is concerned with sensual desire, the physical
world and feelings.2 As such it extends far beyond the parameters of one’s skin to include
other people, animals, birds, insects, grasses, micro-organisms — the entire biosphere
itself.

On one occasion at Savatthi, Gotama posed the rhetorical question: “And what,
bhikkhus, is comprehension (pariffia)?” to which he replied: “The ending of greed, the
ending of hatred, the ending of confusion. That is called ‘comprehension.”19 Such
comprehension is neither inflected nor determined by the habitual reactivity of one’s greed,
hatred or confusion. In positive terms, we might describe it as an understanding that is
open-hearted, clear-headed, compassionate and equanimous.

We have already seen how exactly the same phrase: “the
ending of greed, the ending of hatred, the ending of confusion” is also the definition of
nirvana."' If “comprehension” and “nirvana” are synonymous, then the four tasks must
overlap and interweave with one another. If the first task, to “comprehend dukkha,” is
equivalent to the ending of greed hatred and confusion, then how does it differ from the
third task, to “behold the ceasing (of greed, hatred, confusion),” i.e. nirvana? This is a
matter of emphasizing different facets of a single experience. At times we might focus on
this way of comprehending the world in which we are embedded, and at other times on
being aware of how such comprehension is devoid of attachment, aversion and vanity.

For this reason, I prefer to talk of a fourfold task than four separate tasks.

Arising (Samudaya) is to be let go of (pahana)

We are the kind of creatures who react whenever we come into contact with the world
through our senses. If what we meet feels pleasant, we react with attraction; if it feels
unpleasant, we react with aversion; and if it feels neither pleasant nor unpleasant we react
with restlessness or boredom. To these we could add guilt, self-doubt, vanity, inadequacy,
anxiety, conceit, paranoia, expectation, wishful thinking and so on. Such reactions are
entirely natural. They are neither good nor bad. Strictly speaking, they are not even
“mine.” They are simply what happens when an organism impacts with its environment.

They are what arises.

The second facet of the fourfold task is to let go of what arises. This might seem
contradictory. For if what arises as a reaction to the world is just another natural feature of
the world, then surely it falls within the scope of the first task as something to be
comprehended and embraced like everything else. How, you might reasonably ask, can I
embrace and let go of areaction such as aversion at the same time? Another verse from

the Dnhammapada provides a clue:

	The sage moves through a village
	Just as the bee gathers pollen
	And flies off without harming
	The flower, its color or fragrance.

The image of the honeybee evokes an engagement with the world that allows one to
acquire what is necessary for survival yet with a sensitivity of touch that leaves no trail of
destruction in one’s wake. The sage who lets go of reactivity does not shun involvement
with the world, but moves nimbly and lightly through it.

The word I am translating as “reactivity” is tanha, which literally means “thirst” or
“craving.” Here is the classical definition of tanha as found in The Four Tasks:

This is the arising (samudaya): it is craving (tanha), which is repetitive, wallows in
attachment and greed, obsessively indulges in this and that: craving for stimulation,
craving for existence, craving for non-existence.

Tanha is as complex an idea as dukkha. Just as “suffering” fails to convey the full sense of
dukkha, so “craving” fails to convey the full sense of tanha. If we understand dukkha as
shorthand for “life,” we can think of tanha as shorthand for the myriad reactions that life
provokes in us. In both cases, the terms flag a central feature of what they denote (the
tragic in the case of dukkha; desire in the case of tanha) but that one feature is not
sufficient to capture the entire spectrum of what is meant by the term.

Tanha is more than just craving. As an element within the classical doctrine of the
twelve links of conditionality, it is what arises in reaction to the feelings that come from
sensory contact with the differentiated world (namaripa) of a conscious being. This
includes hatred and indifference, loathing and boredom, as much as craving and desire.

Moreover, the arising of tanha is not just a series of isolated events but a self-reinforcing
cycle of “repetition,” which “wallows” and “indulges” in worries, fears, obsessions and
fantasies. In response to a gnawing sense of lack, tanha yearns to fill that inner void with
ever more intense stimulation. Rooted in feelings of existential incompleteness and
inadequacy, it insists on inflating one’s ego and affirming one’s importance in the world.
And whenever these strategies fail to deliver, it lapses into a hankering for intoxication,
oblivion and death.

In describing greed, hatred and confusion as fires, Gotama is aware of how
reactivity is something that flares up whenever a spark ignites it. Once it has flared up, we
tend to believe in and indulge it, thereby further fanning the flames. In this way, reactivity
both amplifies the pain we initially experienced and triggers proliferating thoughts
(papafica). The Buddha compared physical pain to being struck by an arrow, which is then
unnecessarily amplified by a “second arrow” of mental disquiet and anguish.'4 In an
alternative version of the links of conditionality, he likewise spoke of how feelings of
pleasure and pain give rise to perceptions that lead to thoughts that endlessly proliferate.'5

Gotama recognized how human beings spend an inordinate amount of time
absorbed in the amplifications and proliferations of reactivity. He talks of them as the
“snares” or “fishhooks” of Mara. Once one has been trapped or snagged, it is difficult,
painful and fruitless to struggle to wrench oneself free, for that struggle is likely to be
another variant of the very reactivity one is struggling against. It just tightens the grip of
the snare or embeds the hook’s barb deeper in one’s flesh. By failing to understand why
and how they keep getting “tricked” by the “beautiful and hideous shapes” conjured by
Mara,'people become “like tangled balls of string.”"”

By remaining in thrall to these repetitive, obsessive reactions, we also become
increasingly vain and self-centred. Following the traditional twelve link sequence of
conditionality, such reactivity (tanha) engenders clinging (upadana). A text in the

Connected Discourses offers the account of clinging given to Ananda that led to his
conversion. The speaker is his preceptor, a man called Punna Mantaniputta:

It is by clinging, Ananda, that ‘I am’ occurs, not without clinging. It is by clinging to
form, feelings, perceptions, inclinations and consciousness that ‘I am’ occurs, not
without clinging. Suppose a young woman — or a man — youthful and fond of
ornaments, would examine her own facial image in a mirror or in a bowl filled with
pure, clean water: she would look at it with clinging, not without clinging. So too, it
is by clinging to form that ‘I am’ occurs, not without clinging....”18

What Punna describes here is not the everyday sense of “I am” but the obsessive self-
regard of the narcissist, the person who sees the world solely in terms of his own desires
and fears. Wherever such an egoist looks, he beholds only an image of himself reflected
back. In considering others merely as means to realize his own ends, he loses the
capacity to empathize, which, in the end, leads to a spiral of alienation, loneliness and
despair.

This self-centred isolation is a state of inner “aridity” (khila). The discourse On the
Aridity of the Heart presents this aridity as the very opposite of stream-entry.'9 A person
who suffers from it is paralyzed by his doubts about the teacher (satthar), the dharma and
the community (i.e. his core values), and feels anger and displeasure towards his
companions. While one who has embarked on the eightfold path is said to have entered a
stream (an unambiguous metaphor of a flourishing life), the one who remains entangled in
reactivity is said to experience a barrenness where nothing grows. In the Connected
Discourses, a short text presents aridity as threefold: “the aridity of greed, the aridity of
hatred and the aridity of confusion.” Using the terminology of the fourfold task, it explains
how the eightfold path needs to be cultivated in order to comprehend and let go of all
three. Since the ending of this reactive triad is how Gotama defines both comprehension
and nirvana, the discourse implies that a life grounded in a nirvanic embrace of dukkha is
no longer arid but has become abundant.

I constantly need to remind myself that the language of the discourses does not
take for granted, as later Buddhist thinkers and we moderns do, a self-evident split
between an experiencing subject “in here” and an objective world “out there.” Gotama did
not parse human experience in this way. For practical purposes (as in his instructions on
mindfulness) he may distinguish between “inner” and “outer” foci of attention, but terms
such as “subject” and “object” do not occur in the discourses. We should not assume,
therefore, that reactivity or aridity are psychological phenomena that only refer to our
interior life. At the risk of reading too much into a prefix, the word samudaya (arising)
could literally be translated as “co- (sam) arising (udaya),” while its Tibetan equivalent kun
‘byung literally means “all-arising.” Both terms suggest that when a reactive pattern such
as hatred arises, it simultaneously triggers an emotion of rage that surges through the
organism and configures a world that presents itself as intrinsically hateful and fearful.

We tend to regard the appearance of such a fearful world as a “projection” of our
mental state. But this is a reading of the situation based on the cultural habit of
interpreting our experience psychologically. No matter how much we tell ourselves that it
is just a projection, such reassurance does not significantly alter either how the world
appears to us or how we feel about it. From the perspective of a dharma practitioner, the
task of “letting go of what arises” entails releasing one’s grip on the whole picture: angry-
me-facing-hostile-situation. It is not simply a question of breathing deeply to calm my
rattled mind; I need to cleanse the doors of my perception as well. This requires
suspending the default habit of seeing the world as being either hostile, desirable or
boring. One of the most effective ways of doing this is to train oneself to comprehend the
world as an infinitely suffering world.

There is a symbiosis between “comprehending life” and “letting go of reactivity.”
The fourfold task entails cultivating an embrace that is also a release. This is akin to a
dance, where each partner holds the other in a way that both are able to move with
optimal freedom and grace. The more we fully understand the precarious/mysterious
situation we are in, the more our egocentric reactivity will either die down of its own accord
or appear increasingly petty and absurd. And the more we stop believing what our
compulsive mental habits keep telling us, the more the world will tend to reveal itself in all
its poignancy, tragedy and sublimity.

Letting go of reactivity is a consequence of comprehending reactivity. In many of the
dialogues with Mara, the Buddha concludes by saying: “I know you, Mara,” whereupon
Mara vanishes. Such comprehension (here explicitly compared to the knowing of a person
— Mara) sees the tricksterish wiles of reactivity for what they are: the seductive, infantile
play of an organism that is primarily — and, for the most part, redundantly — preoccupied
with its biological survival. In one exchange, Mara declares to the Buddha: “Life is long;
live like a milk-sucking baby!” to which Gotama retorts: “Life is short; live as though your
head were on fire!”21 This passage highlights how reactivity is a deeply seated instinctive
behavior that will persist as long as we inhabit this body with which we were born. To
release oneself from its hold requires coming to a mature comprehension of one’s
mortality, of how each fragile moment rests on the pumping of a muscle and the drawing of
a breath.
