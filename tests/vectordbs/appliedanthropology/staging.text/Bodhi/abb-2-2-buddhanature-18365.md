# Buddhanature

Stephen Batchelor

In November 1241, the Japanese Zen master Dogen wrote an essay entitled
“Buddhanature” (Bussho). It opens by citing the Nirvana Sutra, a Mahayana scripture
composed around five hundred years after Gotama’s death, where the Buddha announces
that all living beings have buddhanature. “But what,” asked Dogen, “does this mean?” He
answered that it explains the phrase: What is it that just got here?

“What is it that just got here?” This is the question Huineng, the sixth patriarch of
the Zen school in China, posed to the young monk Huairang, who had just walked more
than seven hundred miles from Mount Song to Nanhua Monastery to see him.
Buddhanature is the capacity you have to become a question for yourself. The practice of
Zen is to stay with this question, to let it sink into your consciousness, infuse the
awareness of everything within and around you, penetrate into your nerves and flesh and
bones, becoming, as the Gateless Gate puts it, like a red hot iron ball in your stomach that
you can neither digest nor disgorge. The more you become this question, the more you
hang suspended between “is” and “isn’t,” “yes” and “no,” “this” and “that.” All the brilliant
answers you conjure up turn out to be trite and useless. You are confronted with the
enormity of your own ignorance. You realize that you don’t really know anything at all.

You return to the primal shock and confusion of the legendary Prince Siddhartha as
he encountered for the first time a sick person, an old person and a corpse, and on each
occasion stammered to his charioteer: “Will this also happen to me?” The first Zen masters
disdained the rarified speculations of the Buddhism of their day and sought to recover
such existential questions. They maintained that only a visceral engagement with this
“great doubt” would lead to a “great awakening” that would reverberate at the same pitch
as the questions that triggered it.

After eight years at Nanhua Monastery, Huairang reported to his teacher Huineng
that he had finally understood something. Huineng asked him: “What is it?” Huairang
replied: “To say it is something misses the point.” After several pages of abstruse
reflections, minute textual analysis and inconclusive conjectures, Dogen concludes his
essay on buddhanature by citing Nanyang, another disciple of Huineng. When asked what
was the buddha mind, Nanyang replied: “Fences, walls, tiles, and pebbles.”

Buddhanature is a metaphor of hope. Despite the frailty, brevity, confusion and
despair of human life, we find ourselves awed by beauty, inspired to selfless acts of
generosity, moved to write poetry, enriched by moments of love, overwhelmed by the
sheer wonder of being alive. We possess an uncanny ability to understand and respond to
the often counter-intuitive sayings of those considered to be wise. All this points to an
innate capacity to appreciate and be moved by what lies beyond the limits of our narrow
egocentrism.

As Gotama’s dharma developed into Buddhist orthodoxy, it assumed an
increasingly annihilationist stance to the world. The aloof, serene monk came to be
regarded as the model practitioner of the dharma. The dogma of no-self inculcated a deep
suspicion of self. Any lingering sense of self had to be identified and uprooted. Nirvana, the
goal of the path, was conceived as the ending of birth and death, and thus the negation of
self and life itself. Around five hundred years after Gotama’s death, a counter-movement
— the Mahayana — arose in India, which sought to reverse this tendency by advocating
the positive idea of buddhanature.

Buddhanature appeals to the imagination rather than the intellect, to feelings more
than thoughts. It may confirm our deepest intuitions, and open us to intimations of the
sacred. The Peerless Continuum, an influential Mahayana treatise on the topic, compares
buddhanature to the honey inside a honeycomb surrounded by a swarm of bees; to a
kernel of wheat covered by its husk; to a nugget of gold buried in a mound of filth; to an
unknown treasure hidden in the house of a pauper; to a bejeweled Buddha statue wrapped
in a foul piece of cloth; to the embryo of a king in the womb of destitute woman; to a
golden statue encased in its clay mould. In each instance, something of great value is
shown to be extremely close but concealed from view.

Buddhanature is nearer to us than anything else but obscured by the greed, hatred,
selfishness and stupidity that routinely plague us. These reactive patterns are understood
as adventitious, non-essential taints, which obscure the pristine awareness that is our
essential nature. Such awareness is not the contingent, unstable consciousness of
ordinary experience, but the awakened Buddha mind itself, which is always present but
rarely noticed. The Nirvana Sutra describes it as “eternal, blissful, self and pure.”
Buddhanature is equated with the ultimate nature of reality itself. It is that spark of the
Buddha deep inside you, within which all virtues and excellence reside.

Buddhanature provides a metaphysical foundation for an ethics of certainty. If a
thought, word or deeds originates in the intuitions of your buddhanature, you can be
confident it is grounded in ultimate truth and fundamental goodness. Whatever you do will
be the right thing to do. Ethical choices need no longer be risks based on your own
uncertain and incomplete assessment of complex moral situations. In theory at least,
buddhanature enables you to tap directly into the source of the Buddha’s wisdom and
compassion. And if your own judgment is still too clouded by reactivity to be entirely
reliable, you can always trust in the wise counsel of others who are more attuned to
buddhanature than yourself.

For buddhanature to have a transformative impact on how you live, it has to be
directly realized in practice. Whether by a sudden breakthrough in Zen meditation or on
receiving pointing-out instructions from a Dzogchen master, the experience of
buddhanature has to become a deeply felt reality for you. No amount of studying the
Nirvana Sutra or the Peerless Continuum can substitute for such non-conceptual
awareness. Analysis and reason alone are incapable of grasping the mystical truth of this
primal ground of your being.

Yet in extricating you from the dead-end of annihilationism, the idea of
buddhanature risks leading you to the dead-end of eternalism. In both cases you will miss
the elusive and fluid middle way. If buddhanature is an eternal, transcendent, pure and
self-existent consciousness, how does it differ from the Atman of the Upanisaas, the
immortal Self that is the spark of God within you? The doctrine of buddhanature begins to
sound like Buddhist theism in all but name. “Just as space, being all pervading, cannot be
polluted because of its subtle nature,” says the Peerless Continuum, “similarly, abiding
everywhere among living beings, buddhanature remains unpolluted by defilements.” Turn
to the words of Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita and you find almost exactly the same
verse. The sole difference is that the Gita says “Self” instead of “buddhanature.”

How would a Zen master deal with this theistic turn? Six months after writing
“Buddhanature,” Dogen composed an essay called “Radiant Light” (Komyo). To illustrate
the theme he cites a story about the tenth century Chinese Zen teacher Yunmen. “Every
one of you without exception,” said Yunmen to a gathering in his monastery, “possesses
the radiant light. But when you look for it, you see only a deep darkness. So what is your
radiant light?” The audience remained silent. Yunmen answered on their behalf: “The
monks’ hall, the Buddha hall, the kitchen pantry, the main gate.” Yunmen seeks to free his
listeners from their moth-like fascination with ideas like “radiant light” and get them to
embrace instead the sublime banality of their everyday existence.

In the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, buddhanature is simply your emptiness of
inherent existence. For Tsongkhapa, the school’s founder, this emptiness was the ultimate
unfindability of a permanent essence or substance lying at the core of who and what you
are. Instinctively, you may feel that beneath all your contingent physical and mental traits,
there lies a non-contingent core of self or consciousness that exists inherently,
independent of all conditions. Some Indian traditions believe that this constant sense of
being a detached witness to experience is an intimation of one’s eternal soul. For the
Gelugs, the most radical and counter-intuitive of Gotama’s teachings was his suspicion of
all such intimations and beliefs.

Only in seeing the absence of such an inherently existent self are you freed to
become the kind of person you aspire to be. Understanding the self’s emptiness of
inherent existence does not deny your everyday sense of self. It enables you to appreciate
how you are a contingent, changing, fluid, tragic, joyful process of continual becoming.
Rather than an eternally radiant soul temporarily imprisoned by attachments and
ignorance, you are a work in progress, a constantly unfolding project. Gotama’s
revolutionary insight was to realize that men and women become enlightened not in spite
of being contingent and impermanent creatures, but because of being contingent and
impermanent creatures. When seen in this way, your very own humanity is your
buddhanature.

The Gelug conception of buddhanature is ethical rather than ontological. It is based
on an understanding of what you can become rather than what you essentially are. Your
uniqueness as a person is due to all the myriad choices you have made, relationships you
have formed, works you have accomplished, children you have raised. You individuate and
flourish through having the courage to take risks that impact the world you share with
others. This on-going fashioning of a contingent, evolving self rather than the presence of
a transcendent, essential self is what constitutes your buddhanature.

As part of my training as a Gelug monk monk, I studied the Overview of
Buddhanature by Chokyi Gyaltsen, the sixteenth century author of the monastic textbooks
of Sera-je Monastic College in Lhasa. I was surprised to learn in the Overview that the
idea of buddhanature originated in the early canonical literature of “Hinayana” Buddhism.

As the source of this claim, Chékyi Gyaltsen cited an unidentified scripture (agama),
which many years later I located among the Numerical Discourses of the Pali Canon. The
passage talks of the “family of noble ones” (ariya vamsa). Those who belong to this family
are characterized by four traits: they are content with their clothing, content with their food,
content with their lodging, and they delight in letting go and cultivation.

The capacity to become a question for oneself and the intuitive yearning for
transcendence can only be realized when the material conditions needed to support life
are met. This account of buddhanature recognizes the indispensable role played by social
and economic factors in providing the necessary conditions for awakening. No matter how
sincere your aspirations to pursue an examined life, without adequate clothes, food or
shelter you will be preoccupied with the challenges of physical survival alone. Even if you
live in an affluent society where your basic needs are met, you may still be thwarted in
your wish to practice the dharma if, for political or religious reasons, that society does not
tolerate it.

At the conclusion of his essay “Buddhanature,” Dogen quoted Nanyang’s definition
of the buddha mind as “fences, walls, tiles, and pebbles.” He highlighted the blunt fact that
without the inanimate material conditions for sustaining life, the entire project of awakening
would be a pipe dream. Yunmen’s comment about radiant light makes the same point.
Instead of speculating about the innate luminosity of mind, Yunmen recognized the source
of awakening to lie in the inert bricks and mortar around him: “The monks’ hall, the Buddha
hall, the kitchen pantry, the main gate.”

Those who belong to the “family of noble ones” are people who delight in letting go
(pahana) and cultivation (bhavana). This refers to the practice of the four tasks, of which
letting go of reactivity is the second and cultivation of the eightfold path the fourth. Once
your material needs are met and social conditions are supportive, you have the opportunity
to become the kind of person you aspire to be. The practice of letting go of reactive habits,
emotions and fixed opinions leads to nirvanic moments of lucid stillness, which allow the
space and freedom to cultivate a way of life no longer driven by narcissism, greed and
hate. The tasks thereby provide a template for individual human flourishing. When
practiced communally, they serve as a matrix for the emergence of a culture of awakening.

Not only is buddhanature our capacity to let go of reactivity and cultivate a way of
life, it also lies at the heart of the third task: beholding the stopping of reactivity. To see this
stopping is to see nirvana itself. For nirvana is nothing other than the free and open space
of possibility disclosed each time the clouds of habitual reactivity disperse. In opening up a
comprehensive path of human flourishing, such nirvanic space is also buddhanature.

Buddhanature is called the womb (garbha) of the true person (tathagata). A womb is
a space that can be fertilized, bring an embryo to term, and give birth to a child. Nirvana
too is a fertile space that can nurture the development of a new perspective on life, which
then assumes concrete form through acts of speech and body in the world. The
interdependence of families and wombs emphasizes the centrality of biological metaphors
in imagining buddhanature. Both metaphors associate buddhanature with maternal
qualities that nurture life and enable it to flourish.

Yet the Buddhist traditions that teach the doctrine of buddhanature rejected the
womb metaphor. The Chinese translated the Sanskrit garbha as “treasure house” (zang)

while the Tibetans chose to render it as “heart-essence” (nyingpo). Since both languages
have words for “womb” why, quite independently, did the Chinese and Tibetan translators
not use it? It may have been due to their reluctance to employ the term for an intimate and
sexual feature of a woman’s body to represent such a noble idea. For celibate monks
trained to contemplate the female body as an object of disgust and revulsion, it may have
bordered on obscene to describe buddhanature in this way.

Only women have wombs. A treasure house is a sterile image associated with
powerful and wealthy men. It preserves the idea of a space but one of cold stone, brick
and metal rather than living flesh and blood. Heart-essence (nyingpo) preserves the
connection to a bodily organ — the heart (nying) — shared by men and women alike. But the
heart is incapable of giving birth to another life. In both cases, buddhanature is
desexualized and defeminized. The capacity to wake up is no longer associated with the
fertility of women. Indian Buddhists, familiar with the religious use of the word garbha from
the “golden womb” (hiranya garbha) described in Vedic creation myths, would have found
the metaphor less troubling.

The monastic suppression of the feminine creates the conditions for its disruptive
return. The ninth century Chinese scholar-monk Deshan became incensed on hearing of
the Zen doctrine of sudden awakening, which rejected the need to study the scriptures. He
decided to travel to the far south of China to refute the proponents of these heretical ideas.
On the way he came across an old woman selling dumplings by the roadside and stopped
to eat. Noticing the books he was carrying on his back, she said: “I have a question for
you. The Diamond Sutra says: ‘The past mind can’t be found, the present mind can’t be
found, and the future mind can’t be found.’ So what mind are you displaying now?” Deshan
was speechless. His certainties were shaken. Soon after, the Zen master Longtan gave
him a lamp then immediately blew out its flame. At that moment, Deshan experienced a
sudden awakening. “All these mysterious doctrines,” he admitted, “are but a speck of dust
in a vast emptiness.” He then set fire to all his books.

Here is a man who has retreated from life into a world of abstract ideas and
opinions. Snared in the binaries of right and wrong, Deshan had come to justify his
existence in terms of doctrinal correctness. He would meet any threat to his certainties
with anger and violence. “I'll go drag them from their caves and exterminate their ilk,” he
said of his opponents, “and thus repay the kindness of the Buddha!” Only when hungry
and weary did he let down his defences, allowing the opening for an old woman to expose
the shallowness of his convictions.

As the eleventh century Indian Buddhist scholar and abbot Naropa was poring over
his texts one day, a terrifying shadow fell over him. He swung round to see a hideous old
woman standing in the doorway. “You understand what those books mean?” she asked.
“Yes,” he answered. The hag broke down in tears, dropped her stick, and shouted: “Liar!”
Shaken from his certainties, Naropa asked her who did understand their meaning. She told
him to go and see her brother Tilopa. When Naropa finally tracked down the elusive Tilopa,
he turned out to be “a dark man dressed in cotton trousers, his hair knotted in a tuft, with
protruding bloodshot eyes.” Naropa prostrated before him and became his disciple.

The re-emergent feminine forced Naropa to recognize how he was stuck in the
dead-end of intellectuality. One cannot live by reason alone. To be fully alive, Naropa had
to resuscitate those atrophied parts of himself from which he had become alienated.
Human flourishing is achieved through integrating reason with feeling, imagination,
creativity and intuition, not by denying them. The ugly hag casting her shadow and the
wild, unkempt Tilopa serve as counter-images to the serene, cerebral monk with shaven
head and downcast eyes. Naropa went on to develop yogic practices that integrated the
energies of the body, dream experiences, and in-between states (bardo) into the practice
of dharma.

When all is said and done, buddhanature has to do with human flourishing.
Extending from our most private intuitions to our broadest civic responsibilities, it signifies
our capacity to be wholly human. Buddhanature is the irrepressible force of life itself. To
quote Nanyang again: “this benevolent nature can cause the raising of an eyebrow and the
twinkling in an eye. It is employed when coming or going, and it pervades the body. If you
tap your head, the head knows it. If you stamp your feet, the feet know it. ... Aside from
this there is no other buddha.”
