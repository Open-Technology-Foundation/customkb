Part One, Sonnet IV, Rainer Maria Rilke

You who let yourselves feel: enter the breathing
that is more than your own.

Let it brush your cheeks

as it divides and rejoins behind you.

Blessed ones, whole ones,

you where the heart begins:

You are the bow that shoots the arrows
and you are the target.

Fear not the pain. Let its weight fall back
into the earth;
for heavy are the mountains, heavy the seas.

The trees you planted in childhood have grown
too heavy. You cannot bring them along.
Give yourselves to the air, to what you cannot hold.

If by Czeslaw Milosz

If I cannot ascend to Paradise —-

clearly those circles are too high for me —-

I would like to spend time in one of the regions of Purgatory
gaining liberation from the phantoms of my mind,
whose power, though I never trusted it completely,
I remember very well.

The agony before her window in an empty street,
Or the idealizing call for a perfect love,

Spiritual, nearly super terrestrial.

Should I laugh now or weep? Yet my body

carries these splinters of exaltation and unreason.
I would like even yet to see clearly,

To not lie to anybody, or to myself,

And to invoke, supposing they were there,

my good intentions.

Awakened by Czeslaw Milosz

In advanced age, my health worsening, I woke up in the
middle of the night, and experienced a feeling of happiness
so intense and perfect that in all my life I had only felt its
premonitions. And there was no reason for it. It didn’t
obliterate consciousness; the past which I carried was there,
together with my grief. And it was suddenly included, was a
necessary part of the whole. As if a voice were repeating:
“You can stop worrying now; everything happened just as it
had to. You did what was assigned to you, and you are not
required anymore to think of what happened long ago.” The
peace I felt was a closing of accounts and was connected with
the thought of death. The happiness on this side was like an
announcement of the other side. I realized that this was an
underserved gift and I could not grasp by what grace it was
bestowed on me.

Keeping Quiet, Pablo Neruda

Now we will count to twelve
And we will all keep still.

For once on the face of the earth,
Let’s not speak in any language;
Let’s stop for one second,

And not move our arms so much.

It would be an exotic moment
Without rush, without engines,
And we would all be together
In a sudden strangeness.

Fishermen in the cold sea

Would not harm whales

And the man gathering salt
Would not look at his hurt hands;

Those who prepare for green wars,

Wars with gas, wars with fire, victories without survivors,
Would put on clean clothes

And walk about with their brothers

In the shade, doing nothing.

What I want should not be confused with total inactivity.
Life is what it is about;
I want no truck with death.

If we were not so single minded about keeping moving
And for once could do nothing,

Perhaps a huge silence might interrupt this sadness

of never understanding ourselves

and of threatening ourselves with death.

Perhaps the earth can teach us.
As when everything appears dead
And later proves to be alive.

Now I'll count up to twelve
And you keep quiet and I will go.

A Dialogue of Self and Soul, part II, WB Yeats

My Self. A living man is blind and drinks his drop.
What matter if the ditches are impure?

What matter if I live it all once more?

Endure that toil of growing up;

The ignominy of boyhood; the distress

Of Boyhood changing into man;

The unfinished man and his pain

Brought face to face with his own clumsiness;

And the finished man among his enemies? —
How in the name of Heaven can he escape
That defiling and disfigured shape

The mirror of malicious eyes

Casts upon his eyes until at last

He thing that shape must be his shape?

And what’s the good of an escape

If honour find him in the wintry blast?

Iam content to live it all again

And yet again if it be life to pitch

Into the frog-spawn of a blind man’s ditch,
A blind man battering blind men;

Or into that most fecund ditch of all,

The folly that man does

Or must suffer, if he woos

A proud woman not kindred of his sould.

Iam content to follow to its source
Every event in action or in thought;
Measure the lot; forgive myself the lot!
When such as I casts out remorse

So great a sweetness flows into the breast
We mush laugh and we must sing,

We are blest by everything,

Everything we look upon is blest.

The Idea of Order at Key West , by Wallace Stevens

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.

The water never formed to mind or voice,
Like a body wholly body, fluttering

Its empty sleeves; and yet its mimic motion
Made constant cry, caused constantly a cry,
That was not ours although we understood,
Inhuman, of the veritable ocean.

The sea was not a mask. No more was she.
The song and water were not medleyed sound
Even if what she sang was what she heard,
Since what she sang was uttered word by word.
It may be that in all her phrases stirred

The grinding water and the gasping wind;

But it was she and not the sea we heard.

For she was the maker of the song she sang.
The ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea

Was merely a place by which she walked to sing.
Whose spirit is this? we said, because we knew
It was the spirit that we sought and knew

That we should ask this often as she sang.

If it was only the dark voice of the sea

That rose, or even colored by many waves;

If it was only the outer voice of sky

And cloud, of the sunken coral water-walled,
However clear, it would have been deep air,
The heaving speech of air, a summer sound
Repeated in a summer without end

And sound alone. But it was more than that,
More even than her voice, and ours, among
The meaningless plungings of water and the wind,
Theatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped
On high horizons, mountainous atmospheres
Of sky and sea.

It was her voice that made
The sky acutest at its vanishing.

She measured to the hour its solitude.

She was the single artificer of the world

In which she sang. And when she sang, the sea,
Whatever self it had, became the self

That was her song, for she was the maker. Then we,
As we beheld her striding there alone,

Knew that there never was a world for her
Except the one she sang and, singing, made.

 

Ramon Fernandez, tell me, if you know,

Why, when the singing ended and we turned
Toward the town, tell why the glassy lights,
The lights in the fishing boats at anchor there,
As the night descended, tilting in the air,
Mastered the night and portioned out the sea,
Fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles,
Arranging, deepening, enchanting night.

Oh! Blessed rage for order, pale Ramon,
The maker’s rage to order words of the sea,
Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,
And of ourselves and of our origins,

In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds.

Postscript, by Seamus Heaney

And some time make the time to drive out west

Into County Clare, along the Flaggy Shore,

In September or October, when the wind

And the light are working off each other

So that the ocean on one side is wild

With foam and glitter, and inland among stones
The surface of a slate-grey lake is lit

By the earthed lightning of a flock of swans,

Their feathers roughed and ruffling, white on white,
Their fully grown headstrong-looking heads

Tucked or cresting or busy underwater.

Useless to think you'll park and capture it

More thoroughly. You are neither here nor there,

A hurry through which known and strange things pass
As big soft buffetings come at the car sideways

And catch the heart off guard and blow it open.

Expect Nothing, by Alice Walker

Expect nothing, Live frugally
On surprise.

become a stranger

To need of pity

Or, if compassion be freely
Given out

Take only enough

Stop short of urge to plead
Then purge away the need.

Wish for nothing larger

Than your own small heart

Or greater than a star;

Tame wild disappointment
With caress unmoved and cold
Make of it a parka

For your soul.

Discover the reason why

So tiny human midget

Exists at all

So scared unwise

But expect nothing, Live frugally
On surprise.

Adam's Curse, by William Butler Yeats

We sat together at one summer’s end,

That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,
And you and J, and talked of poetry.

I said, ‘A line will take us hours maybe;

Yet if it does not seem a moment’s thought,
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.
Better go down upon your marrow-bones
And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones
Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;
For to articulate sweet sounds together

Is to work harder than all these, and yet

Be thought an idler by the noisy set

Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen
The martyrs call the world’

And thereupon

That beautiful mild woman for whose sake
There’s many a one shall find out all heartache

On finding that her voice is sweet and low
Replied, “To be born woman is to know—
Although they do not talk of it at school—

That we must labour to be beautiful.’

I said, ‘It’s certain there is no fine thing

Since Adam’s fall but needs much labouring.
There have been lovers who thought love should be
So much compounded of high courtesy

That they would sigh and quote with learned looks
Precedents out of beautiful old books;

Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.’

 

We sat grown quiet at the name of love;

We saw the last embers of daylight die,

And in the trembling blue-green of the sky
A moon, worn as if it had been a shell
Washed by time’s waters as they rose and fell
About the stars and broke in days and years.

Thad a thought for no one’s but yout ears:

That you were beautiful, and that I strove

To love you in the old high way of love;

That it had all seemed happy, and yet we’d grown
As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.

Aubade, by Philip Larkin

I work all day, and get half-drunk at night.
Waking at four to soundless dark, I stare.
In time the curtain-edges will grow light.
Till then I see what’s really always there:
Unresting death, a whole day nearer now,
Making all thought impossible but how
And where and when I shall myself die.
Arid interrogation: yet the dread

Of dying, and being dead,

Flashes afresh to hold and horrify.

The mind blanks at the glare. Not in remorse
—The good not done, the love not given, time
Torn off unused—nor wretchedly because

An only life can take so long to climb

Clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never;
But at the total emptiness for ever,

The sure extinction that we travel to

And shall be lost in always. Not to be here,
Not to be anywhere,

And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.

This is a special way of being afraid
No trick dispels. Religion used to try,
That vast moth-eaten musical brocade
areated to pretend we never die,
And specious stuff that says Vo rational being
Can fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing
That this is what we fear—no sight, no sound,
No touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with,
Nothing to love or link with,

The anaesthetic from which none come round.

And so it stays just on the edge of vision,

A small unfocused blur, a standing chill
That slows each impulse down to indecision.
Most things may never happen: this one will,
And realisation of it rages out

In furnace-fear when we are caught without
People or drink. Courage is no good:

It means not scaring others. Being brave
Lets no one off the grave.

Death is no different whined at than withstood.

Slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.
It stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,

Have always known, know that we can’t escape,

Yet can’t accept. One side will have to go.
Meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring
In locked-up offices, and all the uncaring

Intricate rented world begins to rouse.

The sky is white as clay, with no sun.

Work has to be done.

Postmen like doctors go from house to house.
