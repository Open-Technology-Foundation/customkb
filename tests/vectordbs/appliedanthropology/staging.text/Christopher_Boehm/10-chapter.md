In Chapter 10 of "Hierarchy in the Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior," Christopher Boehm explores the complexities of human nature, emphasizing its inherent contradictions and ambivalences. He critiques various scholarly perspectives on human nature, from tabula rasa assumptions to those that view it as a series of powerful drives. Boehm advocates for a nuanced understanding that recognizes the dual tendencies of altruism and egoism, suggesting that human nature is shaped by structural contradictions that lead to psychological ambivalence.

The chapter delves into the historical philosophical debate between Hobbes and Rousseau regarding human nature, highlighting how these biases influence anthropological interpretations. Boehm introduces the concept of "reverse dominance hierarchies," where egalitarian societies suppress individual dominance through social controls, thus fostering cooperation and social harmony.

Boehm discusses various theories of human nature, including evolutionary psychology and sociobiology, while emphasizing the need for a holistic approach that considers the interplay of innate dispositions. He argues that human political behavior is characterized by a tension between dominance, submission, and the resentment of domination, which is evident in both human and primate societies.

The chapter also examines the role of cultural practices in shaping moral communities that promote altruism and cooperation, despite the underlying competitive instincts. Boehm posits that the evolution of morality and egalitarianism has significantly altered human political dispositions, leading to complex social structures that balance individual autonomy with collective governance.

Ultimately, Boehm asserts that understanding the ambivalence in human nature is crucial for anthropological analysis, as it reveals the dynamics of decision-making and social behavior in various cultural contexts. He concludes by reflecting on the implications of these insights for contemporary political systems and the future of democratic egalitarianism.
