In Chapter 3 of "Hierarchy in the Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior," Christopher Boehm examines the moral transgressions and social control mechanisms among hunter-gatherers, particularly focusing on the concept of "upstartism." Upstarts are individuals who threaten group autonomy through bullying, selfishness, or attempts to dominate others, violating the egalitarian ethos that governs these communities. Boehm argues that hunter-gatherers actively engage in social control to prevent such behaviors, fostering a low-key approach to social relations that discourages competition and dominance.

The chapter discusses how hunter-gatherers, like the !Kung of Tanzania, utilize ridicule and sharing practices to mitigate the risks posed by successful hunters who might develop a sense of superiority. Successful hunters are expected to downplay their achievements, and communal sharing of meat serves to prevent any one individual from monopolizing power or resources. Boehm highlights the importance of social norms and community vigilance in maintaining egalitarianism, noting that while conflicts may arise, they are often subtle and preemptively addressed.

Boehm also shares personal anecdotes from his fieldwork and references Jean Briggs' experiences with the Utku Eskimos, illustrating how even anthropologists can inadvertently become "upstarts" through cultural misunderstandings. Both accounts emphasize the delicate balance of social interactions in egalitarian societies, where displays of aggression or dominance are met with social sanctions, including ostracism.

Ultimately, the chapter underscores the active role of egalitarian social control in preventing hierarchical tendencies and maintaining group cohesion, suggesting that such dynamics are essential for understanding human political behavior and the evolution of social structures.
