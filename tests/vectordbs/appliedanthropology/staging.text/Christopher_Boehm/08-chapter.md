In Chapter 8 of "Hierarchy in the Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior," Christopher Boehm examines the evolution of egalitarian societies and the mechanisms that enable them to form and sustain themselves. He argues that while despotic hierarchies can arise without intentionality or morality, egalitarian societies require a conscious effort to counteract innate tendencies toward dominance.

Boehm contrasts the social structures of different species, noting that chimpanzees exhibit a linear hierarchy for males and a looser one for females, while egalitarian societies, like those of humans, are characterized by collective rebellion against dominant individuals. He suggests that the ability to form large coalitions is essential for subordinates to challenge alpha males and establish egalitarian norms.

The chapter discusses the role of weapons in altering social dynamics, allowing for the potential elimination of dominant figures through collective action. Boehm posits that the development of hunting weapons, alongside cognitive and communication advancements, facilitated the emergence of egalitarian societies by enabling individuals to strategize and cooperate effectively.

Boehm also introduces the concept of "actuarial intelligence," referring to the intuitive understanding of complex social systems that allows hunter-gatherers to maintain social equity through sharing and cooperation. He emphasizes the importance of moral communities and the communication of shared values in sustaining egalitarian structures.

Ultimately, Boehm concludes that the transition to egalitarianism was likely a revolutionary process, influenced by environmental pressures and cultural diffusion among groups. He suggests that the foundations for egalitarian societies were in place with Anatomically Modern Humans, who possessed the necessary cognitive and communicative capabilities to support such social structures.
