In Chapter 6 of "Hierarchy in the Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior," Christopher Boehm examines the political spectrum of hominoids, utilizing a typology originally developed for birds to analyze social hierarchies in primates, including humans. He aims to position humans on a continuum from egalitarianism to despotism by comparing them with the three African great apes: chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos.

Boehm describes the despotic end of the spectrum, where individuals exert strong dominance, particularly in chimpanzees, where male competition for status and mating opportunities is prominent. He contrasts this with gorillas, where silverbacks dominate their harems but with less continuous competition, and bonobos, who exhibit more egalitarian behaviors with females forming coalitions that challenge male dominance.

The chapter further explores human political behavior, emphasizing the flexibility and adaptability of human social structures compared to other primates. Boehm discusses various human societies, from egalitarian hunter-gatherers to more complex chiefdoms and kingdoms, highlighting that while humans can exhibit despotic tendencies, they also have a strong inclination towards egalitarianism, particularly in small groups.

Boehm concludes that human nature includes a universal drive to dominance, but also the capacity for egalitarianism, suggesting that humans can navigate a wide range of social structures influenced by environmental and cultural factors. He posits that while humans are inherently capable of despotism, they also possess the mechanisms to suppress it in favor of egalitarian practices.
