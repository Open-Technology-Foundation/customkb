In Chapter 2 of "Hierarchy in the Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior," Christopher Boehm reflects on his fieldwork with wild chimpanzees at Gombe Stream Research Center, drawing parallels between chimpanzee and human political behavior. He emphasizes the hierarchical nature of male chimpanzee societies, characterized by status rivalry and conflict resolution strategies. Boehm recounts a significant day in the field where he observed complex social interactions, including displays of dominance and the dynamics of hunting and sharing prey among males.

He notes that while chimpanzees exhibit hierarchical tendencies, they also engage in behaviors that reflect improvisation and flexibility in their social structures. The chapter highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of dominance and submission in chimpanzee interactions, suggesting that these behaviors are essential for maintaining social order.

Boehm contrasts chimpanzee politics with human egalitarian societies, arguing that humans possess innate tendencies toward both hierarchy and egalitarianism. He critiques anthropological perspectives that overlook the role of human nature in shaping social organization, asserting that leveling mechanisms are necessary to counteract innate dominance tendencies. The chapter sets the stage for exploring the evolution of egalitarian behavior in human societies, particularly among hunter-gatherers, and the implications for understanding human political nature.
