In Chapter 9 of "Hierarchy in the Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior," Christopher Boehm presents a new evolutionary perspective on altruism and the dynamics of natural selection in Paleolithic societies. He challenges traditional social biology assumptions, arguing that between-group selection played a significant role in shaping human nature, particularly by promoting altruistic traits at the expense of within-group selection.

Boehm introduces the "Genetic Paradox of Altruism," suggesting that the spread of egalitarianism among Paleolithic humans allowed for the emergence of altruistic behaviors that contradict the prevailing view that natural selection only favors selfishness and nepotism. He posits that altruistic genes can thrive when between-group selection is robust enough to counteract the advantages of free-riding within groups.

The chapter discusses the mechanisms through which egalitarian societies mitigate dominance hierarchies and promote cooperation. Boehm highlights the importance of social control, consensus decision-making, and moral communities in suppressing free-riding behaviors, thereby enhancing the retention of altruistic traits. He emphasizes that the dynamics of natural selection are influenced by cultural practices that encourage sharing and cooperation among non-relatives.

Boehm also explores the impact of environmental pressures and climatic fluctuations on inter-group competition, suggesting that these factors may have amplified between-group selection during the Late Paleolithic. He proposes that warfare could have further contributed to the retention of altruistic traits by increasing extinction rates among groups, thus favoring those with more cooperative individuals.

Ultimately, Boehm argues that the evolution of altruism in humans is rooted in complex social structures and cultural practices that have shaped human behavior over generations, leading to significant changes in human nature itself.
