In the first chapter of "Hierarchy in the Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior," Christopher Boehm examines the origins of political egalitarianism, arguing that it is rooted in human evolutionary history rather than being a modern invention. He references Alexis de Tocqueville's observations on American political equality and contrasts this with the historical context of egalitarianism, which he traces back to the Paleolithic era.

Boehm explores the dual nature of humans as both hierarchical and egalitarian, highlighting the complexities of human social structures compared to other primates. He introduces an "ambivalence model" to explain the contradictory tendencies within human nature, suggesting that while humans can form egalitarian societies, they also exhibit significant hierarchical behaviors.

The chapter discusses how egalitarian societies maintain their structure through collective social sanctioning against dominant individuals, emphasizing the role of moral communities in regulating power dynamics. Boehm argues that egalitarianism requires active effort to sustain, as it faces challenges from individuals seeking dominance.

He also critiques historical and contemporary attempts at enforced equality, noting that the political landscape often favors hierarchical structures. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the implications of egalitarian behavior for understanding human nature and social organization, setting the stage for further exploration of the evolution of altruism and social traits in subsequent chapters.
