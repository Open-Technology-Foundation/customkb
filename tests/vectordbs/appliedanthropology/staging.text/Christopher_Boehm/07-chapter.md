In Chapter 7 of "Hierarchy in the Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior," Christopher Boehm delves into the political nature of humans and their ancestors, juxtaposing the ideas of Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He argues that both autonomy and a competitive drive for dominance are inherent in human nature, shaped by evolutionary processes over seven million years.

Boehm constructs a political portrait of the Common Ancestor of humans and the three African great apes using a four-species cladistic model. He identifies shared behavioral traits that likely existed in this ancestor, emphasizing the importance of social dominance hierarchies and group leadership. He suggests that while humans exhibit egalitarian tendencies, they also possess a capacity for hierarchical organization, with dominance and submission behaviors being innate.

The chapter explores the dynamics of coalition behavior, highlighting the presence of small political coalitions among different species, including humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Boehm posits that the Common Ancestor likely had the potential for both small and large coalitions, which could challenge dominant individuals within their groups.

Boehm also discusses the concept of ambivalence in dominance and submission, suggesting that subordinates may harbor desires to dominate while simultaneously submitting to authority. This ambivalence is reflected in the vocalizations of chimpanzees, particularly the "waa," which can express defiance against dominant individuals.

Ultimately, Boehm argues that the evolutionary basis for human egalitarianism stems from the potential for collective subordinate rebellion against dominance, a trait that may have been present in the Common Ancestor and has evolved into the complex social structures observed in modern human societies.
