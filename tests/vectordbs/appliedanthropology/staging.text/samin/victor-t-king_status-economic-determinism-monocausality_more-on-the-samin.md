# STATUS, ECONOMIC DETERMINISM AND MONOCAUSALITY: MORE ON THE SAMIN

By VICTOR T. KING

I read with great interest A. Pieter E. Korver’s article on “The Samin
Movement and Millenarism’ (Bijdragen, 132 (1976), pp. 249-266) in
which he is critical of my analysis of this movement." It is always tedious
to have to defend one’s own position and I am not prepared to do this
at great length, but in the light of the continuing debate on the Samin
perhaps I can clarify a few issues on which I have apparently been
misunderstood.

First, I am by no means certain of the validity of Korver’s analysis of
the Samin movement from the perspective of millenarism (pp. 250-255).
Benda and Castles? drew attention to the fact that the specifically
millenarian features attributed to the movement in the literature may
have been the result of the erudition of the Dutch writers themselves,
their expectations and apprehensions, and deception and ‘coloured
reports’ on the part of their informants (pp. 212, 229). Korver, how-
ever, makes a distinction between millenarism and messianism; he says
‘not all millenarian movements are Messianic in the sense that they
assign a role to a Messiah in the establishment of the millennium’
(p. 253). He then criticises Benda, Castles and myself for concluding
that ‘the Samin movement does not fit in with the millenarian tradition’
(p. 254). But the point here is that we mainly addressed ourselves to
the phenomenon of ‘messianism’, and following Benda and Castles
I state that ‘the Samin movement at least was not messianic’ (p. 472).*
This was carefully qualified by noting that in later phases of the
movement messianic themes and the belief in a millennium were present,
although probably peripheral (pp. 465-6, 472, and see Benda and
Castles, p. 230).

Secondly, there is the general problem of the influence of economic
factors in the emergence of the Samin movement. One of Korver’s
objections to my analysis is that I attempt to substitute ‘Benda’s and
Castles’ principally economic explanation of the origin of the Samin
movement with a social one’ (p. 255), that by implication I am in
disagreement about ‘the economic causes of the origin of the [Samin]
movement put forward by Benda, Castles and The Siauw Giap’,* that
explicitly I have forwarded the ‘thesis that economic factors were of
little importance for the Samin movement’s origin’ (p. 259) and finally,
again by implication, that I see economic factors as ‘insignificant’ in
‘a rebellion initiated by middle peasants’ (p. 260). By progressive and
subtle steps Korver has completely misrepresented my argument. Let
me simply offer the following quotations from my paper, viz. ‘I am
not convinced that material deprivation is the most important factor
in rural unrest, although certainly it must be taken into account’ (p. 461,
my emphasis). I do not see that this statement renders economic factors
as ‘insignificant’; also ‘economic factors are important but are often
overemphasised’ (p. 462, my emphasis). In Korver’s paper my original
word ‘important’ is somehow translated as ‘of little importance’. Fol-
lowing Benda and Castles I went on to describe in some detail the
material factors which played a part in the emergence and spread of
the Samin movement, for example, the creation of forest reserves which
deprived peasants of this resource, the replacement of corvée by money
taxation in an area where cash was particularly difficult to obtain, the
introduction of a land tax, and so on (pp. 462-5).

It surprised me then, after Korver’s charge that I neglected economic
factors, to find myself also guilty of an ‘inverted economically determi-
nistic line’, in that I implied that ‘economic factors such as exploitation
and serious poverty must invariably induce poorer peasants to rebel and
join such movements as that of Samin’ (p. 255, my emphasis). The
so-called determinism in my argument is provided by Korver’s insertion
of the word ‘invariably’. Again he distorts my argument. There is nothing
in my paper which would lead to the view that I am an ‘inverted
economic determinist’. What I did say explicitly was that, ‘It is tempting
to suggest that initial Samin activity was largely dominated by the
landowning element, but that later taxation increases led to its spread
to the relatively poorer peasantry’ (p. 465, my emphasis). I also said
‘4. it ts probable that economic hardships had greater motivational
force for poorer elements in the rural population’ (p. 467, my emphasis).
Is this deterministic? I think not. Furthermore, in my discussion of the
poorer peasantry I specifically recognised the additional importance in
conversion to the cause of ‘messianic appeal’, ‘variations in teaching’
and ‘different doctrinal principles’ (p. 465).

What this all adds up to is my suggestion that overall the role of
economic factors must be recognised, but that their influence is variable
depending on social context (p. 463). In the Samin case under con-
sideration I forwarded the tentative proposition that certain economic
factors had subsequently a greater impact on some of the poorer rural
elements, whereas with the more wealthy peasants economic deprivation,
which is often overemphasised (see esp. p. 464), had its social counter-
part in status deprivation. I fail to see how any of this warrants the
charge that on the one hand I fail to assign importance to economic
factors, and on the other hand, I am unconsciously an economic
determinist.

This brings me now to the core of the dispute. Korver disagrees with
the emphasis on ‘status’ and ‘worth’ deprivation in my analysis of
Saminism. On reflection let me readily admit that like those I have
criticised for overemphasising economic factors I have tended to place
greater stress on the notion of ‘status’ in my desire to give it due atten-
tion. It is to Korver’s credit that he has recognised this in my argument.
But what he appears to lose sight of is the close relationship which exists
between the material dimension and status. The impression Korver
conveys of my analysis, after his inaccurate criticism that I deny the
importance of economic factors, is that I see status as some mysterious
entity divorced of material content. In fact, I quite specifically stated
that ‘economic factors only become more analytically meaningful in
their social structural context, particularly in the context of status dif-
ferentiation in Javanese village society’ (p. 463). I viewed the ‘economic’
as an important element in peoples’ notions of social grading, but I also
conceptually isolated status for analytical purposes (as does Aberle; see
King, p. 467). For example, after my consideration of the operation of
economic factors in the emergence of the Samin movement, I continued
by stating that ‘other less tangible factors have played an equal, if not
more important role in the development of the Samin movement, and
the nature of status differentiation has a direct bearing on the following
analysis’ (p. 466, my emphasis). Let me reiterate my point that I was
reassessing the importance of material deprivation because it tends to
be overemphasised and because it is ‘easily observed and apparent’
(p. 461). I did not lose sight of the fact that status divisions are based
in part on such factors as landownership, wealth, occupation and work
relationships (p.466). Along these lines I pointed out that ‘the land-
owning villagers in particular, valued land just as much for its status
value as for its material value, although both aspects are obviously
closely interrelated (p. 467, my emphasis). However, on balance, I pre-
ferred to stress the loss of status, rather than material possessions, as
the main motivational force in the early stages of Samin unrest.®

The above may explain why Korver comes out on the side of material
deprivation since he says that, ‘we see that in the ideology of this
[Samin] movement ... an obvious emphasis is placed on elements
relating to a deprivation of possessions’. My point was that material
deprivation is stressed, at the expense of other factors, precisely because
it is more readily and easily articulated by the peasantry, and hence
more obvious and apparent (p. 461). It is the more subtle, less tangible
factors such as status deprivation which are often not voiced so explicitly
by the peasantry and are thus neglected.* But we have to go further
than this. Korver glosses over my discussion of ‘worth deprivation’, but
this too I saw as important in the emergence of the Samin movement.
It is at best a vague concept with the connotation of loss of self respect.
I viewed it in a summary sense as including such factors as material
possessions, status, ethical values, knowledge and so on (p. 468). But
within this image of ‘worthiness’ I suggested that some elements are
more crucial than others, and that for the Samin ‘landownership, success
in farming and its associated status are the central elements’™ (p. 468).
When these were endangered in the contact between village society and
the Dutch administration, then this led to unrest.

Furthermore, I pointed out that certain ideological elements in Sa-
minism tended to support my view that the ‘status’ and ‘worth’ of the
peasant as a farmer (remembering that these concepts also Possess a
material dimension) were threatened. Thus, there was the similarity
between certain Samin beliefs and traditional Javanese fertility cults
with their stress on the role of the peasant farmer (pp. 470-1); Samin
rejection of Islamic and Hindu-Javanese beliefs and the harking back
to a ‘pure’ Javanese peasant society; the rejection of urban values; the
sense of Samin superiority based on their belief that they upheld the
Javanese folk culture (p. 474); the desire for harmony in an agri-
cultural society dependent on the maintenance of balance between man
and nature (p. 473). Finally, I concluded that although religious belief
has motivational force in unrest, in the Samin context its role seems to
be in the promotion of social solidarity.

After correcting Korver’s misunderstanding of my argument, I cannot
see how his charge that my approach is monocausal can be sustained.
I have already pointed to my concern with economic and social factors
and cultural values. In fact, I explicitly stated that ‘A multiplicity of
factors have to be taken into account in each individual case, presenting
a complex picture of cause and effect’ (p. 476).

It remains to consider briefly whether Korver has significantly ad-
vanced our understanding of the Samin movement. I am bound to
say that I do not think so. I have pointed to the qualifications one must
bear in mind in Korver’s adoption of the framework of millenarism.
But having decided on this approach I expected Korver to at least
consider the role of millenarian ideas in the emergence and spread of
unrest, along the lines of Van der Kroef’s analysis of Javanese mes-
sianism.* Unfortunately we are only given three basic sets of factors
‘responsible for the emergence of the Samin movement’, viz. economic,
social and political (p. 256). The economic have already been con-
sidered ad nauseam by Benda and Castles, The Siauw Giap and myself;
Korver adds very little to this part of the analysis. In his consideration
of social factors, he rejects status deprivation as an explanatory factor,
and we are instead presented with ‘the more important’ phenomenon
of ‘social disintegration’ (p. 263). May I simply refer Korver to my
remarks on the ‘lack of strong social articulation’ as ‘one of a number
of factors in the outbreak of effervescent religious movements’. I also
endorsed Worsley’s view of these movements as an important unifying
mechanism ‘arising from a lack of social integration’ (p. 475). In his
attempt to cast doubt on status deprivation Korver also states that ‘The
fact that many Saminists shunned village society and the authorities
seems . .. to be prompted more by a strong desire to be left in peace...’
(p. 262). He then considers in the emergence of the Samin movement
the factor of the ‘sense of political powerlessness’ and the inability to
‘voice ... grievances through concerted political organization or action
in the modern sense’ (p. 264). All this echoes my points concerning the
Samin denial of the legitimacy of all authority, their desire for ‘the
right of self-determination within their own organisational framework’, 
and their willingness to reach a modus vivendi with other interest groups
to enable them to live in peace without interference (p. 475).

The point of my article was to move beyond the obvious economic,
social and political factors operating in the Samin movement and to
attempt to analyse its more subtle social and cultural features. I believed
this to be the way forward.
