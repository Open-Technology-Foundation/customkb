Indonesia, as a nation of "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika" (Unity in Diversity) with hundreds of ethnic groups, has several tribes that continue to preserve their traditional customs.

The Samin people are descendants of the followers of Samin Surosentiko, who taught the philosophy of "sedulur sikep." The Samin community prefers to be called "sedulur sikep" and dislikes being referred to as a tribe. They expressed their resistance against the Dutch in non-violent ways, such as refusing to pay taxes to the Dutch authorities. Currently, the Samin community can be found in the forests of Bojonegoro and Blora. In Bojonegoro, they reside in the hamlet of Jepang, Margomulyo village. Nowadays, they have integrated with the general population and engage in farming within the forest.

One of the tribes in Indonesia is the Samin tribe, originating from the dense forests of Blora Regency, Central Java, and also Bojonegoro Regency, East Java.

This time, our destination is a village located in the teak forest of Bojonegoro, where the Samin tribe resides.

Administratively, this village is located in the Japan Hamlet, Margomulyo Village, Margomulyo District, Bojonegoro Regency. If you think about it, the location of this village is not too far from the main road connecting Ngawi with Cepu City, approximately 7 KM away, with a fairly straight road condition. On the right side of the road, there is a future housing complex for the residents of Margomulyo Village, while on the left, there is a mosque. There are actually many hidden villages behind the dense teak forest, one of which is Japan Hamlet.

In front, there is the Samin Monument.

From the Samin Monument, it's still about four kilometers to Japan Hamlet, friends.

In August 2019, the Bojonegoro Regency Government inaugurated the Samin Sedulur Sikep Monument at this location.

The construction of the Samin Sedulur Sikep Monument symbolizes that the Samin people in Japan Hamlet are an inseparable part of the cultural civilization in Bojonegoro Regency.

The Samin people still hold firmly to their traditions and cultural customs.

One positive aspect of the Samin teachings is their consistent behavior in upholding honesty, avoiding envy and malice, not harboring negative thoughts, and being genuine without pretense.

This is the atmosphere of the village in Japan Hamlet, also known as the Samin Village of Bojonegoro.

In Japan Hamlet, there are 251 households, with most houses still being simple. If you think about it, the houses here are mostly made of wood.

According to the head of Japan Hamlet, in the past, all the houses here were made of teak wood. Over time and with the development of the era, some houses have been built with bricks.

The Samin people living in Japan Hamlet are known for being friendly and open to anyone visiting the village.

In front, you can see a simple house that also serves as a grocery store in this hamlet. Visiting this village feels like being taken back to the 1990s, a time full of simplicity.

Living in the middle of the teak forest, most of the Samin community works as farmers, planting rice, corn, peanuts, and more.

During the Dutch colonial era, the Samin people had a unique way of resisting the Dutch colonizers by refusing to use violence.

They refused to pay taxes and did not comply with any government regulations. Such methods actually confused the Dutch, causing them to leave Margomulyo Village.

Now we are at the house of Mbah Harjo Cardi, an elder of the Samin tribe in Japan Hamlet.

Unfortunately, we couldn't get much information from Mbah Harjo Cardi due to his hearing issues.

The Samin descendants, however, continue to uphold their traditions.

Mbah Harjo Cardi wishes for the preservation of their customs and traditions.

The Samin people have a unique way of life, and their village remains a testament to their enduring culture.
