# The Philosophy of Wong Sikep

**Followers of Samin Surosentiko; Feared by the Dutch**

Assalamualaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh. I am NF from Pustakaswara. This time, I will try to present a discussion about the Samin community. The Samin community, also known as Wong Sikep, indeed has a unique way of life. Their existence since the early 20th century until now still raises many questions. Wong Sikep can be found in the Blora district, their place of origin, extending to Bojonegoro, and even reaching Kudus.

Wong Sikep are followers of Samin Surosentiko. The figure of Samin is still obscure, meaning that information about Samin Surosentiko is still unclear. Some say that Samin Surosentiko was illiterate, unable to read or write. However, Dutch newspapers in the Dutch East Indies referred to him as a Javanese philosopher or a free thinker from Java.

In oral tradition, it is often mentioned that Surosentiko is told as the son of Raden Surowijoyo, also known as Raden Aryo. Raden Aryo, the father of Samin Surosentiko, is also referred to as Samin Sepuh, a descendant of the regent of Ponorogo, named Sumoroto. Samin Sepuh is said to have chosen or once became a Bromo in his youth, robbing the wealth of the rich at that time to distribute it to the poor. Samin Sepuh is also associated with the group Tiang Sami Amin, which inspired the name Samin.

The way of life of Wong Sikep indeed differs from the majority of Javanese society. Among the most notable is their refusal to pay taxes. Therefore, it is not surprising if questions arise about whether Samin is a way of life or a worldview initiated by Samin Surosentiko and followed by Wong Sikep, or if it is merely a resistance against Dutch colonialism.

A book I am holding now helps answer perspectives about who Samin is and how his movement was. This book is titled "Samin: Mysticism of Farmers Amidst Turmoil," written by Anis Sholeh Ba'asin and Muhammad Anis Ba'asin, a father and son duo. This book is published by a publisher in Semarang and interestingly, it is prefaced by Kyai Haji Ahmad Mustofa Bisri or Gus Mus and also Ganjar Pranowo, the Governor of Central Java.

Before we discuss more about the Samin community, it would be good to invite you to listen to an interview or read a report in the Dutch newspaper Het Nieuws van de Dag on the edition of March 5, 1907. This newspaper published a report on the interrogation results of the Rembang Resident's officer with Samin Surosentiko, who was arrested. During the interrogation, especially about taxes and the thefts of wood committed by him and his followers, I quote:

The officer asked, "What is your name?" Surosentiko answered, "My name is Lanang. People call me Surosentiko or Samin." Lanang here means male. Then the next question was, "Where do you live?" Surosentiko answered, "My body is my home. My hut is in the village of Ploso Wetan," meaning in the Blora area.

Further questions revolved around whether Samin Surosentiko believed in God or had a religion, and his answers were quite intriguing to be further investigated or interpreted in the context of Samin's teachings. For instance, when asked if he believed in God or anything else, Surosentiko answered, "No, I have never seen God, so I do not believe." Regarding whether he stole wood, he answered that the wood was indeed owned by the state, but when the residents needed it, they could take what they needed, so there was no prohibition, and he rejected the prohibition on taking teak wood from the forest.

With that conversation, we can see the mindset developed by the Samin community. To further clarify, I will present the first question and answer, but this was conducted by a Patih officer to one of Samin Surosentiko's followers. The report in this book is presented quite comprehensively, for instance, on page 63.

For example, a Patih officer captured or secured a Samin follower and interrogated him for not wanting to pay taxes. Here it is narrated that the officer asked, "Why don't you pay taxes, or you still owe the state 90%?" because the Patih assumed that Wong Sikep owed 90% because they had not paid taxes. Wong Sikep answered, "I do not owe anything to the state." But you have to pay taxes. Wong Sikep does not pay taxes. These conversations made the Patih officer emotional and slapped the Wong Sikep.

Strangely, the Wong Sikep did not get angry and understood that the officer had a duty to collect taxes, and it was the state's duty, so it was natural for him to be angry. And I, as Wong Sikep, will not pay taxes. So, the Patih officer was confused because he slapped him, and yet he did not get angry and understood that he had a duty to collect taxes, and I had a duty not to pay taxes.

This passive resistance was carried out by Wong Sikep, even to the point where in court, the property of Wong Sikep was eventually confiscated and sold to pay, and the excess was given to Wong Sikep. Strangely, Wong Sikep refused because he felt he had never sold anything and therefore did not need to receive any excess money from the sale. This is a depiction of how Wong Sikep lives. They live with their own way, with teachings developed by Samin Surosentiko.

In this book, there are certainly many perspectives of Wong Sikep that I cannot fully present, so you need to read this book. However, there are several points I try to present. First, the views of Surosentiko were greatly feared by the Dutch East Indies government. For instance, Wong Sikep had a belief that they knew what they owned, meaning there was a clear separation: this is mine, this is yours, this is the community's, this is the state's. Therefore, Wong Sikep had a derived teaching, which is ojo drengki srei tukar padu dan kemiren, meaning they were strictly forbidden from envy, stealing, and so on. These moral teachings were developed by Wong Sikep.

The third is that there are two orders that become the philosophy of Wong Sikep's way of working, called tatane wong and tata anggota. Tatane wong refers more to the relationship between husband and wife, as Wong Sikep had a unique view on marital relations. Tata anggota refers to work order, which is how to cultivate agricultural land properly. These two orders are always presented in their daily lives.

Furthermore, there is a teaching that the earth or homeland, as well as wood, belongs to everyone. Therefore, Wong Sikep continues to take wood from the forest, feeling they have the right to manage the land, wood, and water in their area. They will strongly defend this.

Another teaching that was greatly feared or, in other words, caught the attention of the Dutch East Indies government was the saying kebun rujuk lebokno kebun branggah tokno, meaning the colonizers will surely leave the land of Java, and the original Javanese people will remain. This worldview or order made Wong Sikep have their own way of life, which confused the Dutch East Indies government because of their simple, passive views, not taking up arms but refusing to pay taxes, continuing to commit, in quotes, wood thefts, and so on, which certainly harmed the Dutch East Indies government.

This book is quite interesting. Returning to the book, it is full of data and analysis. For instance, conversations between interrogators and Samin Surosentiko are critically analyzed, not taken directly textually. For example, when Surosentiko was asked if he believed in God, he said no, if he believed in heaven and hell, he said no. This book tries to analyze that this could be a way Samin Surosentiko resisted imperialism or colonialism. He used circular words that were not necessarily in his mind. He said he did not believe in God because he had not seen Him, possibly to simplify explaining that God can never be explained with words.

This book tries to reveal perspectives not from the colonial viewpoint of the Dutch but from another perspective. Furthermore, this book is interesting because it reveals much about the chronicles of Samin's history and the life story of Surosentiko. As I mentioned earlier, Surosentiko was born in Blora but was later captured and exiled to Sawahlunto in West Sumatra, where he died in 1904. This book is quite recommended for reading. There are certainly many books discussing Samin. I have found several books or literature about Samin, whether in Prisma magazine, journals, or other research books. In Blora, it is more known in Kelapa Duwur, while in Bojonegoro, it is in the village of Japan in Margomulyo sub-district. Many studies have been conducted, and this book has many footnotes and research literature, providing perspective for readers. Even lay readers will easily understand Samin Surosentiko.

Returning to the question of whether Samin Surosentiko's teachings are teachings or resistance, it could be both, or it could be one of them. You might have your own answer after reading this book.

Thank you. I hope it is beneficial. Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.
