# The Common Characteristics of a Dharma  
*(whether religious, philosophical, professional, or fully secular)*

| Functional Lens | Characteristic | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Ethical Orientation | Provides a **normative compass**—principles of right/wrong, beneficial/harmful, skillful/unskillful. | Guides choice, restrains destructive impulses, fosters pro-social behaviour. |
| 2. Contextuality | Arises from, and is tailored to, a **specific ecological, historical, and technological environment** (*a “seculum”*). | Ensures relevance; prevents one-size-fits-all dogma. |
| 3. Adaptability (Impermanence) | **Evolves** through interpretation, debate, and pragmatic experiment. | Allows the path to stay viable as conditions change. |
| 4. Embodiment | Expressed through **rituals, habits, aesthetics, material culture, and bodily practice** (e.g., posture, diet, design). | Translates abstract ideals into lived, sensory reality; aids learning and memory. |
| 5. Communal Dimension | Cultivates a **sense of belonging and mutual obligation**; often institutionalised (sangha, guild, professional board, civic group). | Social reinforcement, cooperation, identity formation. |
| 6. Narrative Framework | Offers **stories, myths, or shared histories** that situate participants in a larger arc of meaning. | Provides motivation, resilience, and inter-generational continuity. |
| 7. Psychological Regulation | Supplies **cognitive and affective tools**—meditation, reflection, journaling, chanting, peer dialogue. | Reduces suffering, modulates emotion, strengthens attention and perspective-taking. |
| 8. Accountability Mechanisms | Includes **rules, vows, feedback loops, and conflict-resolution procedures**. | Maintains integrity, checks free-riding and abuse. |
| 9. Integration of Knowledge | Selectively **absorbs science, philosophy, and local wisdom**; often reframes them in its own idiom. | Keeps the dharma intellectually credible and practically useful. |
| 10. Orientation to Transcendence (or Ultimate Concern) | Addresses the **big questions** of mortality, purpose, and coherence—even in secular form (“legacy,” “sustainability,” “human flourishing”). | Satisfies existential needs and motivates long-term stewardship. |

## A Schematic “Anatomy” (Layered View)

1. **Values** → Compassion, honesty, curiosity, courage.  
2. **Norms** → “Tell the truth,” “minimise harm,” “share data.”  
3. **Practices** → Peer review, meditation, recycling, community meals.  
4. **Institutions** → Laboratories, dojos, courts, online commons.  
5. **Identity Markers** → Robes, lab-coats, logos, hashtags.  
6. **Feedback & Reform** → Councils, audits, confession, retrospective meetings.

## Why These Traits Keep Re-Appearing

Evolutionary & social-scientific work suggests that dharmas repeatedly converge on these features because they:

* harness evolved pro-social predispositions (fairness, reciprocity, coalition-building);
* reduce coordination costs in large groups;
* provide reliable signals of commitment;
* help individuals cope with uncertainty, grief, and impermanence.

## Illustrative Micro-Examples

| Domain | Mini-Dharma | Manifestations |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Scientific | “Epistemic Integrity” | Replicability rituals, open data badges, conferences. |
| Civic | “Deliberative Democracy” | Town-hall norms, speaking-time tokens, citizen juries. |
| Ecological | “Leave No Trace” | Minimalist gear culture, shared clean-up rites. |
| Tech | “Open-Source Ethos” | Version-control liturgies, contributor codes, community calls. |
| Personal | “Stoic Practice” | Morning reflection, negative visualisation, journaling. |

### Key Take-Away

A dharma is not defined by a single doctrine or deity but by its *function* as an **adaptive, value-laden feedback system** that:

1. Orients behaviour ethically,  
2. Embeds that orientation in lived practice, and  
3. Evolves to keep humans—and their worlds—coherent amid flux.

Wherever you see these three dynamics working together, you are looking at a dharma.
