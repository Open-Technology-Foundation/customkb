[0m[38;5;226mWhy Leaving Australia is the New Australian Dream | Nomad Elite[0m

[38;5;7mI'm here with Dan, one of our Australian clients, and Dan is going to reveal what it's like being
here in Asunción, Paraguay. Thank you so much, Dan.

[38;5;7mThanks, Gerald.

[38;5;214mWhy Dan Left Australia[0m

[38;5;7mThanks for having me, Gerald. It’s been an enjoyable couple of weeks here, actually. I’ve managed to
get a lot of productive work time in.

[38;5;7mThe process for me -- and I’ll try to keep it short and sweet, because it goes back a number of
years -- started from where I made the decision to live an international life. It all started on
YouTube, doing a lot of research on multiple channels, and having a bit of an awakening -- especially in
my country, Australia -- around the COVID times, and how the trajectory of the world was going to be for
us moving forward. That really pushed me in the direction of wanting to become a little bit more
international.

[38;5;7mIn that process, I discovered Paraguay. I already live in Malaysia, so I’ve exited Australia and no
longer do any business or have any connections with Australia, apart from friends and family, of
course. But I was looking for a more permanent, long-term Plan B. It is a Plan B for me right now,
which could turn into a Plan A.

[38;5;7mI see a lot of business and opportunity in Asia, and I’m engaging in that, and I’m really enjoying
the Asian lifestyle. A lot of young entrepreneurs from Australia and Western countries who see the
same trajectory happening in the West -- they’re all rocking up in Asia. So I’m surrounded by
entrepreneurs: really motivated, interesting young people. They’re the future business leaders, so
I’m really enjoying that.

[38;5;7mBut I don’t see any permanent ability to establish myself in Asia. I don’t see too many pathways to
become a citizen, and I’m not Asian. I’m half Guyanese -- my mom is from South America -- so I have a
little connection to this continent. I can’t speak Spanish, but I figured, after doing research on
your channel and others, and then understanding the tax benefits for someone like me who earns income
online, why not give it a go?

[38;5;7mI like how you pointed out and differentiated what you can get out of Asia, and the same also for a
place like Paraguay.

[38;5;7mNow, what’s interesting is that, at one point in the future, I was also looking to immigrate to
Australia -- believe it or not. But I received a job offer, I think it was in 2016 or 2017, from a
friend of mine who I was coaching in CPA marketing. He told me, “Gerald, why don’t you come live in
Australia?”

[38;5;7mThere was a big decision for me back then because I was living in Asia. I was spending time in
Vietnam, and I felt like, Australia -- why not? Back then, that’s like eight years ago. It feels like a
lifetime ago, because so much has happened since then.

[38;5;7mOh yeah.

[38;5;7mAnd I felt like I should take this chance, but then I felt like Australia is so isolated, and we…
where I’m talking before about how overly protective…

[38;5;7mAustralia is about its biosecurity. Believe it or not, the main reason I did not immigrate to
Australia is because of this guy here, because I could not bring him into Australia. It was a
nightmare.

[38;5;7mThey requested me to bring the dog first into Singapore, and then from Singapore into Australia.
Obviously, the whole process was going to be very expensive, but I decided not to do it.

[38;5;7mNow, you see Southeast Asia vs. Paraguay. Southeast Asia as a place to live and enjoy your
life -- because, in my humble opinion, Southeast Asia offers the highest quality of life in the entire
world -- but Southeast Asia lacks real residency like here.

[38;5;7mFor instance, you can get residency without proving economic solvency, which is incredible. In
Southeast Asia, that would be impossible. I don't know of any country that does that. Cambodia has
these renewable visas, but they keep changing on the fly.

[38;5;7mBut you spend time in Southeast Asia to further advance your business.

[38;5;7mAustralia's future -- correct. Where do you see yourself in South America, say in 3 to 5 years’ time? Do
you see yourself living here part-time? Do you see yourself just spending a few months per year here?
What's your overall trajectory for South America?

[38;5;7mI don't know, is the honest answer. But I suspect I might establish a home and a family here.

[38;5;7mSo the reason I started on this journey is because Australia -- you know, I’ll try not to drag this on
too long, but there's a lot of information. Australia is a paradise. Australia is full of wonderful
people, and I'm so grateful to have grown up and seen the Australia of the 1980s, the 1990s, and the
2000s.

[38;5;7mBut there are now two Australias. The two Australias are landlords and rent slaves. I use that word
“rent slaves” deliberately, because the way the economic situation has progressed -- with serious
benefits to property owners and investors -- it's really closed the door to anyone who is not in that
game.

[38;5;7mSo I think many young Australians have a choice to make, and it's pretty easy: if you are going to
inherit property or money, you should buy a place and get a steady job, and you'll be fine, because
property investment is like a protected class in Australia.

[38;5;7mAll the politicians own that. They're the highest property-investor class, and all the Baby Boomers
are the biggest voter class, so that ain't going to change. If you're in property, you'll do really
well.

[38;5;7mBut if you are not staring down the barrel of an inheritance -- or, like me, you've got to wait for your
parents to die, which I'm not waiting for; I'm quite happy having them around -- and if you want to
start a business or be an entrepreneur, Australia will not allow you to be creative and start a
company for a number of reasons.

[38;5;7mIt's the cost of land, it's the cost of labor, it's the cost of electricity. Those reasons alone are
some really good reasons why you just would not touch Australia for most business cases.

[38;5;7mOf course, you could be a politician, you could go and work for a big corporate…

[38;5;7mCould be minor. There are some exceptions, and I’m sure I’ve forgotten other things -- obviously
investing in property.

[38;5;7mBut if you need to bootstrap the creation of a new company, if you’ve got the idea and you know it’s
successful, and in my previous career I’ve got 20 years’ experience behind me and I know I can do
this, the next thing is: Australia is just not the place to do it. You will be destroyed by the
points that I just discussed -- and then add the taxes and the cost of living.

[38;5;7mYou can be on a top salary, paying a top tax rate, and you’re never going to own a house. It’s so
unobtainable now. For someone -- I’m 41 -- I did buy a property in my 20s, but I sold it because I wanted
to start a company. So I spent the next 15 years paying wages, taxes, and overheads. I tried to get
on the property ladder, and I did save, but it just got more expensive every year.

[38;5;7mThen came the realizations that the world was changing. That’s when I made the decision: Australia is
not the place to start and raise a family if you’re going to be an entrepreneur. You’ll be destroyed.
There’s a very good chance you’ll be destroyed -- and I don’t mean physically; I mean financially.

[38;5;7mSo I see Asia and South America and other places around the world as places that give you freedom,
because you’re not being burdened by these huge overheads -- cost of living, accommodation, wages.

[38;5;7mI’m building a team now in Asia and in South America. There’s no way I could take those sorts of
risks and hire four people -- which is soon going to be eight people -- and achieve that in Australia,
because the wages that they require just to live, let alone be successful, will send you bankrupt.

[38;5;7mSo that’s --  I hope I haven’t dragged on too long -- but that’s the trajectory. That’s what led me to this
thought process, and the opportunity is there in Asia to live a fantastic life and to take massive
business opportunities.

[38;5;7mBut why South America?

[38;5;7mEstablishing yourself and maybe living the rest of your life -- obviously this is going to require
learning Spanish, which I haven’t mastered yet. I think South America is probably a good place for
that. A couple of reasons: people are really friendly, the women are beautiful -- that’s just a fact if
you’re a bloke -- and the food is absolutely fantastic.

[38;5;7mThat’s a big thing for me. I travel a lot. This Saturday I’ll get on my 80th flight for this year,
and I notice food and how I feel in a place. South America -- from Colombia to Paraguay to Brazil -- the
food is fantastic.

[38;5;7mSo, to answer your question: where do I see myself? Maybe living up to six months of the year in
Colombia, having a presence here in Paraguay, and then bouncing around the rest of the world. That
was a long answer.

[38;5;7mWell, thank you for the detailed answer. One thing I think we’ll learn from that statement is that
the Five Flag Theory applies to you more than other people, because you’re very international, right?
You’re an international entrepreneur -- you have business interests in multiple countries, real estate
in Australia.

[38;5;7mAnd one thing you told me privately, which was quite interesting, is how long it takes just to save
up for an apartment deposit in Australia. You were referring to the average person needing to save up
probably three to four decades just to have the down payment.

[38;5;7mFor an average salary, if you want to buy the average house in Sydney, following a normal savings
rate, the time it would take to save up that deposit is 41 years. Obviously, you can start with an
apartment, and that figure makes it look quite drastic. But apartments are not that affordable in
Australia when you look around the rest of the world.

[38;5;7mAnd if you’re 40 and you’re thinking, “Maybe I want to have a family at some point,” if you didn’t
buy a place -- like me -- and got into business, you don’t have that time to allow all that capital
appreciation to let you make the jump into the house. So that’s probably one of the things that was
on my mind.

[38;5;7mI actually see much more opportunity in other countries now. Politically and economically, Australia
is accelerating in this direction.

[38;5;7mOh yeah, not good. I mean, real estate in Spain -- we were talking about there being two categories:
landlords and tenants. Now, I own an apartment in Tenerife that I’m going to sell because the laws
are structured in a way to benefit the tenants and not the landlords. Eviction laws are terrible.
They’re horrible -- they’re impossible.

[38;5;7mIt makes no sense to own a home. If you can’t kick your tenant out if they decide to default on their
payments, what’s the point? What’s the point of owning a home?

[38;5;7mSo I feel like there are going to be more people just keeping money in the bank or investing in…

[38;5;7min cryptocurrencies and stuff, instead of putting their money into jurisdictions where the
government’s not protecting them. So here in Paraguay, you know -- real estate in Paraguay -- I think at
some point you might want to consider buying here, but maybe that’s still a bit far out, right?

[38;5;7mHowever, I think here you can protect yourself so much better. Whereas in Europe, not a good place to
own real estate -- I mean, I’m talking about the European Union. In the US it’s better; it depends on
the state.

[38;5;7mMoving to Paraguay, you know -- that’s interesting. Do you have any thoughts you want to share with us?

[38;5;7mLook, this has just been a… I think if anyone who’s watching this is going through a similar thought
process to me, all I would say is: make the jump. You’re not going to regret it, except that you’re
going to have to learn Spanish if you’re going to really invest some time on the ground here.

[38;5;7mOr understand that the opportunities for online business operators, or people earning money
internationally -- it’s real. So maybe take that approach first, and then make a decision on where you
want to base yourself in the future.

[38;5;7mBut the opportunities are endless, and it’s quite an exciting world outside of Australia. Australia
is still wonderful -- don’t regret it one bit. Love returning, love all my family and friends there, so
I’m not dissing Australia. But if you’re maybe feeling trapped in your job or your business, and you
maybe do understand -- or don’t yet understand -- that you’re just being strangled financially and you
can’t see a way out, I think the future looks bright outside of Australia. That’s all I have to say.

[38;5;7mOne thing I want to add is that a person like you has the opportunity to leave Australia. I mean,
think about how many Australians are daydreaming about the life that you are living right here.

[38;5;7mYeah, but I should probably stress: if you’re a young guy, work hard, save your money, and get out of
the country as soon as you can. Because there’s other things at play geopolitically. If you’re a
young guy in your 20s, there’s a very real chance that you could get conscripted into the military.

[38;5;7mAnd if you’re interested in that, that’s fine. I travel all around the world, and all of the Western
countries are changing their laws right now. And for sure, if you think that’s something you want to
participate in, go ahead and do it. But if you’re not subscribing to that way of thinking, just save
your money and come and reap the rewards.

[38;5;7mIt’s so easy to get a digital nomad visa in so many countries. Asunción, Paraguay -- and South
America -- is here. There is a lot of opportunity.

[38;5;7mCruising around the streets here and seeing the amount of development that’s coming into Asunción, it
reminds me of other boom cities that I’ve seen around the world. You can tell when you see so many
cranes and so much construction -- you’re like, stuff’s happening here, and a high quality of life is
being…

[38;5;7mLived by many locals. There are some really nice houses here, and the restaurants that I’ve been to
are so much better than anything I’ve experienced, even just the other day in Monaco in the south of
France.

[38;5;7mI paid for a really nice dinner for two people and drinks -- the equivalent of about 100 Australian
bucks. A dinner that I would expect to pay $600 for in Sydney, I paid 100 bucks. That’s a bargain.
It’s incredible.

[38;5;7mSo thank you again, and I look forward to seeing you next time in Paraguay. Thanks for all your help,
Gerald.

[38;5;7mI’ll close on the fact that if you don’t use an agent like Nomad Elites and you don’t speak Spanish,
you’re going to really struggle trying to do this yourself. So it’s 110% worth your time to engage
the services of someone like yourself and Jesse, because there’s no way I could have got through this
myself -- not in a timely manner. It would be impossible. It’s too many hoops to jump through.

[38;5;7mYeah, well, what we aim to do at Nomad Elites is simplify the entire process, so we’re very glad to
hear that we managed to do that for you.
