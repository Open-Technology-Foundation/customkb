Anthropology is the study of humans, their behavior, societies, and cultures across time and space. It is a holistic discipline that seeks to understand the full range of human experience, from our biological evolution to the diverse ways people live and interact in the world today. 

The field is typically divided into four main subfields: cultural anthropology, archaeology, biological (or physical) anthropology, and linguistic anthropology. Cultural anthropology focuses on contemporary cultures and societies, examining social practices, beliefs, and institutions. Archaeology studies past human societies through material remains, such as artifacts, structures, and landscapes. Biological anthropology explores the biological and evolutionary aspects of humans, including genetics, primatology, and the fossil record. Linguistic anthropology investigates the relationship between language and culture, including how language shapes communication, identity, and social organization.

Anthropologists often use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, such as participant observation, interviews, surveys, and laboratory analysis. A key feature of anthropology is its emphasis on cultural relativism, which involves understanding and interpreting cultural practices within their own context rather than judging them by the standards of another culture.

Applied anthropology is another important aspect of the discipline. It involves using anthropological knowledge and methods to address real-world problems, such as public health issues, education, environmental conservation, and social justice. By bridging theory and practice, applied anthropology demonstrates the relevance of the field in solving contemporary challenges.

In essence, anthropology provides a comprehensive framework for understanding humanity in all its complexity, fostering a deeper appreciation for cultural diversity and the shared aspects of human existence. In this episode, we’re going to talk about anthropology in the broadest sense and some of the problems that stem from common textbook definitions. The term "anthropology," which can be traced back to the 15th or 16th centuries, originates from two ancient Greek words: *anthropos*, meaning "man" or "human" (as distinct from the gods), and *logos*, meaning "subject matter" or "study." Strictly speaking, anthropology is the study of humanity. This can include early hominids and even primates, but more commonly, the term refers to the scientific study of human societies, languages, cultures, and the material remains of those cultures.

If you read a textbook in North America, you’ll likely find that anthropology is divided into four subfields. Personally, I don’t like this division, but it’s very common. 

The first subfield is **physical or biological anthropology**, which focuses on the evolutionary origins and diversity of our species, *Homo sapiens*. This includes fields like paleoanthropology (the study of human fossils), genetics, and behavioral ecology, which examines behavioral adaptations to environmental conditions from an evolutionary perspective rather than a cultural one.

The second subfield is **archaeological anthropology**, or simply archaeology. This is the study of the material remains of human activity, including artifacts, the remains of structures, and what are called biofacts—things like animal bones, plant seeds, or charcoal that were passively consumed by humans but reveal a great deal about how we’ve responded to our surroundings in different historical or prehistorical periods.

The third subfield is **linguistic anthropology**, which is not my area of expertise, but I think it’s fair to say that linguistic anthropologists are interested in how language influences social life. In particular, they study linguistic enculturation—the ways in which learning a language socializes individuals, helping them become members of a community and adopt new cultural practices.

The fourth and final subfield is **socio-cultural anthropology**, often referred to as social and cultural anthropology. Most often, when people say, “I’m an anthropologist,” this is what they mean—they are social or cultural anthropologists. I want to linger here for a moment. There’s a minor distinction between social and cultural anthropology that I might cover in a different episode, but for our purposes, think of socio-cultural anthropology as the study of culture, cultural history, and variation. 

This includes areas like material anthropology, which examines culturally bound objects such as architecture, fashion, textiles, coinage, and tools. A material anthropologist might study the usage or trade of these objects, as well as how they are perceived within the culture in question. Socio-cultural anthropology also encompasses fields like economic anthropology, political anthropology, and the anthropology of religion. Each of the "big four" subfields of anthropology is, in practice, broken into numerous independent and well-established fields of research. This leads to an important point: the problem with presenting anthropology as the "big four," as it is sometimes taught in North America. This framework portrays anthropology as a relatively unified field with a homogeneous vocabulary and a shared vision of scientific inquiry, similar to fields like environmental sciences or engineering. However, this can be very misleading.

In many cases, disciplines within anthropology fail to communicate effectively with one another because they have different intellectual histories, theoretical vocabularies, and methods of data collection. These differences in history, theoretical lexicon, and methodology are what define and distinguish academic disciplines. As a result, while fields like environmental sciences or engineering are more unified in practice, anthropology—when presented as the "big four"—is a much more heterogeneous field than most textbooks suggest.
