# COMING OF AGE IN SAMOA

Margaret Mead was born in 1901 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  She earned her B. A.  degree at Barnard College in 1923 and later received her M. A.  and Ph. D.  from Columbia University.  In 1925, she won a National Research Council Fellowship and went to Samoa to study the lives of adolescent girls in that country.  In 1928, she won another Research Fellowship and visited the Manus tribe in the Admiralty Islands, New Guinea, which resulted in her second book, Growing Up in New Guinea.  Both these works and Male and Female are available in Pelican editions.  Since then, she has studied six other peoples and conducted two follow-up studies to observe changes after World War II. 

Among her recent books are Continuities in Cultural Evolution (1964), Anthropologists and What They Do (1965), Family (with Ken Heyman, 1965), Science and the Concept of Race (1968), and Culture and Commitment (1969). 

An authority on education and child-rearing, she is recognized as an outstanding and original contributor to our knowledge of primitive peoples and modern sociology.  She is Curator of Ethnology Emeritus at the American Museum of Natural History and Adjunct Professor of Anthropology at Columbia University.  She has lectured on child psychology and education at numerous universities and written many scientific monographs and papers.
