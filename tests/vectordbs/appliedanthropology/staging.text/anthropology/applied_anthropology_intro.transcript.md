Applied anthropology is a type of anthropological research that seeks to address real-world problems. Unlike research conducted purely for academic curiosity or personal interest, applied anthropology involves conducting research for an organization or entity that has a specific question or issue they need help understanding. The goal is to use anthropological methods to provide insights and answers to these questions. Essentially, the main difference is that applied anthropology operates within a larger context, often involving collaboration with organizations or groups that require actionable findings.

In terms of methodology, applied anthropology is not fundamentally different from general anthropology. Both rely on anthropological theories and methods. However, the distinction lies in the purpose and application of the research. In general anthropology, the researcher typically decides the focus of their project, discussing and refining it with academic supervisors. In applied anthropology, the research is conducted for an external organization or group, meaning the researcher must also communicate and collaborate with non-academic stakeholders. These stakeholders may not be familiar with anthropology, so part of the researcher's role is to explain the practical relevance of their findings.

Applied anthropology is equally as academic as general anthropology but includes a practical dimension. It involves applying anthropological insights and methods outside the university setting, making it a bridge between academic research and real-world application. Over the years, I have been involved in various applied anthropology projects, many of which have been for the Dutch government in one form or another. For instance, a while ago, we conducted a research project on the need for specialized courts of law in the Netherlands. This required me, as an anthropologist, to interview judges and lawyers to determine whether they believed there should be specialized courts for specific subjects, and if so, why that would be the case.

Engaging in such research means entering a completely different world from the university and academic anthropology. These professionals—judges, lawyers, and others in the legal field—have their own ways of interacting and a distinct culture. As an anthropologist, you need to immerse yourself in their environment to understand the situation and gather meaningful insights.

Currently, I am conducting research on overlapping land claims in Indonesia, specifically in the tropical rainforest areas. This is part of an international project aimed at helping local governments resolve these disputes. It’s a completely different context—working in Dutch courts of law versus the tropical rainforests of Indonesia—but in both cases, the approach is similar. As an anthropologist, you must immerse yourself in the situation, conduct your research, and then return to assist another entity, often a government, in making sense of your findings and applying them effectively.

Do you have advice for future students who wish to conduct applied research? I definitely do, and I think there are three key points to highlight.

First, don't assume that this type of research is easier than a general anthropology master's program. In fact, it is probably more challenging because you are working to satisfy two sets of supervisors: your academic supervisors and the external party involved in the project. The positive aspect of this is that you learn how to navigate and mediate between various parties with different interests, integrating these perspectives into the research you are conducting.

Second, don't be intimidated by this challenge. Once you leave the university and start working, it is highly likely that you will encounter situations where you have to collaborate with multiple stakeholders who have diverse interests. In this sense, applied anthropology provides a valuable opportunity to learn and practice how to manage such dynamics, giving you a real sense of how this process works in practice.

Finally, and perhaps most obviously, once you leave the university and step into the professional world, you may encounter skepticism about your field. When you introduce yourself as an anthropologist, people might ask, "What do you do? What can you contribute?" If you have experience applying your anthropological research and training, you will be able to confidently answer that question. You can explain, "Let me show you why anthropology is valuable for the type of work you're looking to accomplish," and build from there.
